Vuyokazi Dzoyi, 33, was stabbed three times, allegedly by her on-and-off boyfriend, Masixole Zweni, 27. She succumbed to her injuries in hospital last Sunday, and Zweni is expected in court on Tuesday. They two have a 2-year-old son together. Interim chairperson of the Langa Policing Forum Zanele Mbizela said residents joined in the march. “Crimes like these are not supposed to happen, this is very traumatising considering the way it happened. Why can’t men accept it when a relationship is over?” She said the march was also to mobilise residents to attend the court proceedings. “We fully support the call for bail to be denied,and the community must come in full numbers to support this,” she added. Dzoyi’s family said they were grateful for the support. They also felt a lot still needed to be done to bring justice. Dzoyi’s brother, Mandlenkosi, said he believed the accused was not entitled to bail. “I don’t want him to get bail because that would kill me even more,” he said. Dzoyi will be buried on Saturday at her home in the Eastern Cape. Cape Times
