Lulu, as she has been named by the organisation, was found by a passing resident who heard her muffled cries from a plastic garbage bag dumped in a field in Eastridge, Mitchells Plain. Cape of Good Hope SPCA spokesperson Belinda Abraham said: “We called her Lulu because it means precious, pearl, calm, peaceful and protected, and it represents everything she is now and everything she will be in the future. Sadly, it doesn’t represent her past.” The SPCA is looking for the dog’s owners. “We are calling on the public to assist us with any information that can lead to the identification of Lulu’s owners. Abandonment is a crime in terms of the Animals Protection Act No 71 of 1962, and those found guilty of contravening the act could face a fine of R40 000 and/or a prison term of 12 months.” Abraham praised the man who found Lulu. “Mr Daniel reported the incident to a crime group on WhatsApp and he was given the SPCA’s number to call. He waited at Lulu’s side until our vehicle reached her. “He is proof that not all heroes wear capes. She is being treated for an infection – the likely result of the fact that her matted coat is infested with ticks and fleas.” Anyone with information on Lulu, or knowledge of cruelty against animals, can call the SPCA on 021 700 4158/9 or 083 326 1604.
