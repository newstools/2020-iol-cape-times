Cape Town - Under fire Western Cape Judge-President John Hlophe has officially confirmed his high court now also sits in the township of Thembalethu in George. In a notice published by Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng’s office on Friday, Hlophe said the eastern circuit of the high court has been sitting in Thembalethu from November last year. The move is part of the complaint to the Judiciary Service Commission (JSC) by Hlophe’s deputy Judge Patricia Goliath, who says she was never consulted or informed about the decision. According to the notice, the jurisdictional boundaries of the Western Cape High Court’s eastern circuit in Thembalethu will include George, Oudtshoorn, Mossel Bay, Knysna and Plettenberg Bay. The seat will be responsible for all civil processes previously issued out of these magistrate’s courts from last month. ”Judges presiding in criminal matters shall continue to sit as and when so directed by the Judge-President in George, Oudtshoorn, Mossel Bay, Knysna and Plettenberg Bay,” states the notice. In Judge Goliath’s complaint to the JSC, she states that Hlophe told her that his decision to move the circuit court to Thembalethu was the he was sick and tired of his white colleagues who go to George all the time. Judge Goliath said she found Hlophe’s comments both inappropriate and disconcerting. Political Bureau
