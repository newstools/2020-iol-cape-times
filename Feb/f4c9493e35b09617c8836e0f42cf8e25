During the second month of the 2019/20 fire season, the western parts of the province were a little busier than the Southern Cape. Out of the 20 wildland fires recorded, 11 were reported in the Western Cape, with the peninsula being a hotspot. It is estimated that more than 3 000 hectares of vegetation was burned, of which the majority (2 700ha) was in the western parts of the province. Aerial resources flew for a total of 139 hours. Nineteen teams that consist of 20 firefighters were dispatched 43 times, and the most-deployed team was the Working on Fire Hotshot Type 1, who are firefighters who have received high-level specialised training. The second most deployed team was Working on Fire team Newlands. WoF general manager Melany Duthie-Surtie said: “The teams remain on high alert across the province. The most recent fire we had was in the Noordhoek area where our teams, as well as aircraft, were deployed to assist in the fire suppression. "Five of our teams consisting of the Vredenberg, Mamre, Newlands and two Hotshot teams were dispatched to assist.” In total, 23 fires were suppressed, 40 teams dispatched, 36 792 hectares burned and 696 hours flown by aerial resources.
