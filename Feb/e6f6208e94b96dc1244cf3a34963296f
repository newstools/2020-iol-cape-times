Deputy mayor and Mayco member for finance Ian Neilson said complaints about the water and waste directorate related to: “The increase in the tariff charges billed to the accounts, the water management devices (WMD) installation phase that occurred during Level 4B water restriction periods inadequate communication on formal applications for increased water allocation during Level 5 water restrictions “And the functionality of the WMD relating to the daily water limit allocated to the premises.” ”As more consumers experience financial difficulties the office of the City ombudsman noted an increase in requests by consumers to be assisted in negotiating a sustainable payment arrangement.” Neilson said as per the ombudsman policy and by-law, the office of the City ombudsman acts as an office of last resort and after preliminary assessment, 1392 complaints were redirected or escalated to the relevant line department for resolution. “The number of complaints that were allocated for investigations during the 2018/19 financial year were 446 and the office resolved 440,” he said. The City’s annual report states for the 2018/19 the remaining 366 complaints still need to be assessed. “The jurisdiction of 481 complaints received within the 2018/19 financial year still had to be determined there may be times when a complaint is lodged against one directorate but, as an assessment is completed or an investigation unfolds, it may transpire that whilst the complaint may have been made against one directorate, the problem originates in another directorate. “The office of the City ombudsman is therefore not in a position to confirm the outcome of the preliminary assessment of these complaints.” In August, the City health department received over 9000 complaints from the public on elements that affect human health. marvin.charles@inl.co.za Cape Argus
