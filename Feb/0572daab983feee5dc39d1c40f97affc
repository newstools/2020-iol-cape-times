A scuffle between Dlamini and five SANParks rangers last year left him with a broken arm. The incident was caught on video and went viral. In the video, a person is seen twisting Dlamini’s arm behind his back and shoving him into a SANParks vehicle. The rangers were suspended. International law firm Norton Rose Fulbright, which represented athlete Caster Semenya in her case against the IAAF, was appointed by Dlamini. His lawyer, David Kapelus, said he was not able to give more information. “We cannot give an update on the legal proceedings. We are dealing with various issues from the incident at the moment. We are not in a position to give a detailed update.” SANParks spokesperson Reynold Thakhuli said the matter had legal implications and he could not discuss it in detail. “I can confirm that a preliminary report on the issue was completed recently and has been shared with our principals... "At this stage, a full investigation is under way and for obvious reasons we are not at liberty to discuss the details pending its finalisation.” Cape Times
