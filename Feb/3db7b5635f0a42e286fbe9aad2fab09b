HRCT chairperson Mohamed Jaffer said: “It is with great regret, and concern that we, the Race Committee of the HRCT, make this announcement. “This decision was taken after 20 months of planning and negotiation with various stakeholders to bring the first event of its kind to the African continent. “Given the gravity and austerity of our decision, we are obliged to expound. At the heart of our decision is our challenge of dealing with the City’s bureaucracy. After submitting 17 versions of our race route over several months, our committee found that the repeated refutation of the City to officially approve the event had turned into an impasse.” The race was envisaged as a tribute to the countless South Africans who made the ultimate sacrifice for the country’s freedom. The City cited “logistical shortcomings” as the reason for its decision. Executive director for safety and security Richard Bosman said: “This was the second year that the EO has attempted to host the event; however, due to concerns raised about logistics and the feasibility of the race route provided by the event organiser, the City was not in a position to issue the event with a permit.” Cape Times
