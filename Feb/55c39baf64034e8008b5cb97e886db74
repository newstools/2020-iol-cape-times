Pastor Peter Veysie risked his life swimming out into the surf to help the two men in distress. He reached Justin April first and was able to assist him to a sandbank, then help him to the shore. Veysie then went back into the water to go after 26-year-old Quinton Jacobs from Pacaltsdorp. NSRI Wilderness station commander Garth Dominy said Veysie pointed the NSRI crew in the direction in which Jacobs was being swept. “Pastor Peter is commended for his contribution in saving Justin’s life. Quinton Jacobs was being swept, in strong currents, across the shore front towards the Kaaiman’s River Mouth and he was in grave danger." Two fishermen, brothers Ettiene and Cecil Klue from George, who were angling from the rocks, saw Jacobs in difficulty and they realised the peril he faced, said the NSRI. "(Ettiene) reeled the casualty up to the rocks they were on and once he had him at the shore's edge he angled the fishing rod above his head and locked the reel to keep the line tight. “Ettiene, the NSRI applauds your highly commendable efforts that contributed to saving Quinton’s life.”     Cape Times
