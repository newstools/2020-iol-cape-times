Cape Town – City traffic officers made 48 arrests for drunk driving last week – including a 20-year-old suspect who left a trail of destruction in his wake in Milnerton on Sunday. Realising his conundrum at a vehicle checkpoint, the 20-year-old unwisely tried to make an unsuccesful getaway, damaging Metro Police patrol vehicles and his car in the process.
