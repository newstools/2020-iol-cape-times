Mahikeng - A fistfight broke out between security officials and Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) members at the North West Provincial Legislature on Friday, during the State of the Province Address (SOPA). The drama unfolded after Speaker Sussana Dantjie ordered Papiki Babuile, EFF provincial secretary and member of the provincial legislature (MPL) to leave the chamber, this was after he continued to raise a point of order after Dantjie had ruled that premier Job Mokgoro would deliver the state of the province address and no member would be allowed to raised a point of order. While Babuile was leaving the chamber, provincial chairperson and MPL Matshidiso Botswe also interrupted the proceeding, he was ordered to leave but, refused.

Earlier African News Agency identified the injured member as Botswe, but this was incorrect. Botswe was not injured while he was being removed out of the chamber. After the incident the Democratic Alliance (DA) staged a walk-out, stating they would not sit in an illegitimate SOPA. The DA had questioned Mokgoro's credibility to deliver the SOPA because the provincial government was under administration. The EFF MPLs also left and only the African National Congress and theÂ  Freedom Front Plus remained to listen to Mokgoro's state of the province addressed. African News Agency (ANA)
