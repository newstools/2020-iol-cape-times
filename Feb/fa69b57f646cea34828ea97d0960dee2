It is understood that three trucks en route to and from Namibia collided in the early hours. Western Cape traffic chief Kenny Africa said one of the vehicles was burnt out. Emergency services were on the scene and the highway was closed for several hours. Africa said traffic had been diverted on to a gravel road through Algeria to reconnect with the N7. Truckers For Unity SA chairperson Derick Ongansie sent condolences to the families of the drivers, and called on employers in the industry not to overwork drivers. “That was very tragic. We need more regulations in South Africa to look at the working conditions of truck drivers. “Fatigue is a serious issue that employers need to look at and consider before they overuse truck drivers. “In this country, we have lost friends and loved ones because of careless people who drive on the road while asleep. “These big companies need to stop exploiting our people, they should make sure that a driver gets enough sleep before they get on the road, and are mentally and physically prepared to be on the road,” said Ongansie.
