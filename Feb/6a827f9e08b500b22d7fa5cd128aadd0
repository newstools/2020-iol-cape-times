Cape Town – Eskom has upgraded load shedding to Stage 3 to accommodate the shortage of capacity. The embattled power utility said on Saturday Stage 3 rotational power cuts would be in place from 9am today until 5am Monday. This comes less than 24 hours after the power utility warned that only Stage 2 would be enforced over the weekend. "Despite some units having returned to service last night, Stage 3 load shedding will be implemented from 09:00 today to accommodate the shortage the shortage of capacity to replenish emergency reserves," Eskom said. "Unplanned outages or breakdowns were at 10 612MW as at 6am this morning (Saturday), while planned maintenance is at 6 574MW. "As the system is vulnerable, any additional changes on the system performance may require a shift in stage at short notice." It said there is a "possibility of increased load shedding over the next 18 months, as we are conducting critical maintenance  to restore the ageing plant to good health".      #POWERALERT 1Date: 15 February 2020Stage 3 rotational loadshedding will be implemented from 09:00 today until 05:00 on Monday @SABCNewsOnline @IOL @eNCA @ewnupdates @TimesLIVE @News24 @TheCitizen_News @Moneyweb @TheSAnews @SAgovnews @SaturdayStar @SowetanLIVE pic.twitter.com/PJoCtc8n3Z  Eskom is a monopoly power supplier in this country, the effects of it going private are too scary to imagine especially on the price of electricity. The cost of privatizing Eskom is too high to bare.
