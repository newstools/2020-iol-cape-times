The man, who is also Pangaker’s brother in-law, did not want to be named. He said some residents had searched his backyard more than once. “I have told the police that I had nothing to do with any of this. The community comes to scratch in my yard, and they leave a mess,” he said. Tazne’s family spokesperson, Pastor Adam Alexander, said things have not been easy. “Her younger sister has been asking about her and we keep telling her that she will be back soon. We plead with anyone who might have taken her to please bring her back home, it’s not too late,” Alexander said. Tazne, from Clare Street in Ravensmead, was last seen two Fridays ago after leaving home to buy an ice lolly at a nearby shop. She was wearing a white top and red shorts. Police spokesperson Andre Traut said the case was still under investigation and there were no new developments. Veranique Williams from the Pink Ladies said they will search every day until the child has been brought home.
