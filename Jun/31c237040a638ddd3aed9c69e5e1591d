This as the masjid announced it would remain shut. Hendricks’s eldest brother, Ghalied, said the Sheikh had pneumonia, which converted to Covid-19. However, he and his wife were stable and were recovering. “Yes, he and his wife are currently stable. That’s what we confirmed this morning,” he said. In a statement, the Bo-Kaap Covid-19 Community Response Team said the Hendricks family had requested that anyone who had been in contact with the couple take the necessary precautions. “They are in hospital. The family has requested that the community make duah for them. May Allah (swt) grant them full Shifa’ah,” said the community group. The Azzawia Institute called for community support. Shaykh Ismail Londt wished the family a speedy recovery. Cape Times
