Police spokesperson Brigadier Novela Potelwa said police stations could now open up sooner than 48 hours – as was announced with the lockdown regulations – after decontamination, depending on the service provider. “The Grassy Park police station was decontaminated last Tuesday after a Covid-19 case the service provider has to issue management with a certificate declaring the building safe for operation again. "The station cannot open their doors if this certificate has not been issued,” said Potelwa. The Grassy Park Community Policing Forum (CPF) said at least four people had been booked off sick for Covid-19-related illness. Chairperson Philip Bam said: “The CPF recognise that there is anxiety about this virus and its impact. Peace of mind is vital for the optimal functioning of institutions and society at a challenging time like this. "It is therefore important for all roleplayers to be informed, while observing the privacy of affected people.” Cape Times
