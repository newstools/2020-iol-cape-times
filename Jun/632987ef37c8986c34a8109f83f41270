The Bo-Kaap Community Response Team said Jakoet’s death came as a shock to many who hoped he would recover after he was admitted to hospital on June 2 with pneumonia. He was diagnosed with Covid-19 when further tests were done. Jakoet was buried according to Muslim rites at Taronga Road Mosque. The Community Response Team’s Shafwaan Laubscher said they and their neighbouring communities had lost a “gentle giant” who went beyond the call of duty. “He was not only known here but abroad through his practice. We’ve been praying for the family from the day he was admitted and we are all saddened that he didn’t survive to be among those who tell their recovering story. "Doctor Jakoet touched so many lives and with his family contributed to the lives of many vulnerable people in Bo-Kaap by assisting them, even financially,” said Laubscher. Many took to social media to convey condolences and share their experiences with Jakoet. Salt River residents posted appreciation letters, messages of support and flowers outside his home. Cape Times
