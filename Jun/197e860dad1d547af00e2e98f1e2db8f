A Police Dive Unit is continuing to search for a 10-year-old boy who went missing on Wednesday afternoon at Gansbaai harbour, but hopes are fading that they will  find him. He allegedly fell into the water on the outside of the harbour wall while fishing with friends. The NSRI Hermanus duty crew were alerted to the incident at 4.44pm yesterday. NSRI Hermanus station commander Deon Langenhoven said the child may have slipped and fallen into the water as they were preparing to go home. The sea rescue craft Rotarian Burnett was launched and the Weestern Cape government Health EMS and the SA Police Service responded to the scene. “On arrival on the scene, it was found that local divers had initiated a search in the water which was joined by NSRI, EMS paramedics and Police,” said Langenhoven. “Despite an extensive search, no sign has been found of the child and police divers are continuing in a search.” Police have since opened an investigation. It was reported that the boy's father works at the harbour.
