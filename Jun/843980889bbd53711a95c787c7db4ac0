Bellville police officer Adrian Mouton, 38, died at the weekend after he was diagnosed with the virus earlier this month. Mouton’s cousin, Lauren Julie, said the officer was a pillar in their family. “His mother was still mourning the death of his 17-year-old brother who was murdered last year and Adrian was always there for her and the rest of the family. “He looked after the family and he was the one that was reminding the family to wash our hands and sanitise. “He was so concerned for us and we did not think he would get the disease. Our family will never be the same again,” Julie said. Mouton was admitted to hospital on Wednesday and on Saturday the family received a call to say he was on life support. “Half-an-hour later they called again to say he passed on. This Covid-19 is a real devil that is here to steal our loved ones. His wife is in a state. “It all happened so quickly one moment they were together and the next he was gone. He was such a great role model to his son, he was his son’s best friend,” Julie said.
