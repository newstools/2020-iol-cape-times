Cape Town - Residents in the Western Cape should prepare themselves as an incoming cold front is bringing heavy rain and strong winds expected to last until Thursday. The SA Weather Service has advised the City of Cape Town’s Disaster Risk Management Centre that an intense cold front with an associated cut off low is expected from June 9-11. The cold front will result in strong to gale force coastal and interior winds, heavy rain, very cold conditions and rough seas:  "Residents are reminded to please ensure that they remove any potential blockages around their homes to limit the risk of localised flooding." Mayco member for Safety and Security JP Smith added: "With the onset of winter and the predicted bad weather for this week, I call upon motorists to exercise extra caution on the roads. Our transport centre reports several collisions over the weekend, and at least three fatalities."
