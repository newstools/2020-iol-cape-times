Cape Town - The specialised anti-corruption task team established in 2017 arrested 15 suspects, including senior police officers, on Thursday during a pre-dawn raid. They include eight police members, a retired lieutenant-general and six citizens. The unit, which was established by national police commissioner, General Khehla John Sitole, under the leadership of Brigadier Tony Perumal, was tasked to investigate allegations of corruption following serious allegations of corruption and related crimes that dated back to 2017. The team and its investigations are supported by a prosecution team from the investigative directorate within the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) under the leadership of Advocate Hermione Cronje. Members of the specialised task team arrested the suspects on multiple charges including corruption, theft, fraud and money laundering. The suspects were arrested at their homes during the raid and were named by the national commissioner’s office as:   The arrest of another lieutenant-colonel is still pending, which will bring the number of SAPS members implicated in the fraud to 10. The arrests come after the specialised task team's intensive investigation into tender fraud in marking police vehicles. Sitole lauded the task team for their determination in apprehending the suspects. "I have been kept abreast of this extensive and very complicated investigation since its inception. "I am confident that the cases against the arrested suspects are watertight,” Sitole said. A court date for the hearing of the group has not yet been set down and Sitole said more arrests are possible. "We cannot rule out the possibility of more arrests in this matter. Corruption within the SAPS will neither be condoned nor tolerated,” Sitole said. African News Agency/ANA
