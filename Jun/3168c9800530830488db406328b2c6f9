The incident happened on Saturday shortly after 10am on the corner of St Bernard Crescent and St Blaise Street. The clip, which appears to have been captured by a CCTV camera, shows three gunmen arriving in a silver car, getting out and firing a hail of bullets at a man. In the recording, which lasts just over 30 seconds, a little boy is seen walking to a man sitting on the pavement when the car drives by. Three gunmen are seen running towards a man nearby, who falls after the first shot is fired. As those in the street are seen scattering, the man with the toddler jumps up and runs away, leaving the child behind. Cape Argus
