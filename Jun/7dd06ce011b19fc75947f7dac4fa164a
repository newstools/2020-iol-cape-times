Wendy Kondlo, the chairperson of the District Six Student Representative Council (SRC), said they received a communiqué about a student who tested positive at the NMJ residence in Woodstock. “The student remained in the residence for longer than we had assumed. We thought that as soon as she received her results she would be removed. We heard that she stayed there for about two days before they removed her,” she said. She said they were working with management to screen others, including the student’s boyfriend, who stays in another residence. CPUT management said the student was in quarantine along with those she had close contact with. They said the quarantine process was being managed by the campus health clinic, according to the guidelines of the Western Cape Department of Health. “The affected building is being sanitised” said the management. The university said the total number of Covid-19 cases at the institution was 17,of which 9 were staff members. The National Entitled Workers Union, a union that works closely with students, alleged that more students were positive. “We have been made aware that there are five students who tested positive in residences, but the university is hiding those cases,” said the union.
