Four clinics were closed for decontamination, with residents transferred to nearby health facilities after staff tested positive. The clinics in Manenberg, Hanover Park, Netreg and Uitsig were closed to be sanitised. “Health-care facilities are at greater risk of Covid-19 exposure. The City’s focus is to ensure that positive cases are detected early and measures put in place to limit the spread of infection. “When a health-care worker case is detected, a risk assessment is conducted by the City’s Occupational Health and Safety branch to determine if limited services can continue or not. "Where clinic closures are necessitated, clients are referred to other nearby facilities until their facility is reopened,” said Mayco member for health Zahid Badroodien. Meanwhile, of the 18 driving licence testing centres across the city, nine had to be closed on Sunday until further notice. Traffic Services spokesperson Maxine Bezuidenhout said the affected facilities were Brackenfell, Parow, Hillstar, Bellrail in Bellville, Gallows Hill, Fish Hoek, Kuilsriver, Somerset West and Gordon’s Bay. “The buildings are being deep-cleaned and operations will resume as soon as this is done, and sufficient staff members are available to resume their duties. The City apologises for any inconvenience these closures may cause,” said Bezuidenhout. She said those affected by the ­closures would be contacted for the setting of alternative test dates.
