In a more optimistic scenario, infections were likely to peak in mid-August. Professor Salim Abdool Karim, chairperson of the Covid-19 Ministerial Advisory Committee, has warned that the expected spike in season flu will hamper the fight against the coronavirus because the two diseases present very similar symptoms. “They present in similar ways. Flu is generally more severe, however, Covid, in a small proportion of patients, becomes very severe and then often leads to death," Prof Karim commented in a video posted on the National Health Insurance Facebook page. “Our problem is going to be that if we simultaneously have our flu season and our Covid pandemic, we’ll have problems teasing them out. So we’ll have patients who actually have flu coming in to our clinics and hospitals to be treated for Covid-19, and in the process they may be exposed to Covid-19 because our hospitals will be so full of Covid-19 patients.” * For the latest on the Covid-19 outbreak, visit IOL's special #Coronavirus page. ** If you think you have been exposed to the Covid-19 virus, please call the 24-hour hotline on 0800 029 999 or visit sacoronavirus.co.za
