Her passing on Thursday follows that of ANC Women’s League provincial co-ordinator, Lulama Jelele’s husband Andile, who also succumbed to the disease last week. Manuel’s family held a virtual memorial service for her on Saturday, which has been uploaded on to YouTube. Her daughter Pamela Barron said on Sunday it was still hard to accept that her mother had passed on and the family was in mourning. “It was her 94th birthday on the 6th, she video-called everyone. I took her to hospital on Saturday. It was a struggle finding one because no one had a bed,” Barron said. Eventually Manuel was taken in at Pinelands hospital. Barron said she and other family members have been tested for the disease. “My mom was still active and of sound mind,” Barron said. She leaves behind her children Trevor, Pamela, Beryl and Renecia, and 10 grandchildren and nine great-grandchildren. “We salute Mrs Manuel and mothers like her who gave their children to our Struggle. But they went beyond giving their offspring, they also joined and supported them. "We will be forever grateful to all the Mrs Manuels of our country,” said the ANC. Andile Jelele passed away last week. He leaves his widow Lulama, and four daughters, Nomfundo, Nozizwe, Nokuthula and Phelokazi.
