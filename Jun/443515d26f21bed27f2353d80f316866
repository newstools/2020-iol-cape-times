An employee, who asked not to be named for fear of victimisation, said the chairperson was running the organisation to the ground. The chairperson rejected the allegations and said a group of people wrote a long letter to the department making the same allegations, to which he responded and provided the department with all the relevant documents. The employee said: “The CTRC was once a reputable organisation under a board that ensured the mission and vision of the organisation was fulfilled in meeting the needs of integrating refugees and asylum seekers in SA with support services. “Although the organisation continues to provide crucial support services from competent and committed social workers and staff, it is rotten to the core.” They claimed social workers and staff were treated with disrespect, and had to “almost beg or fight for their salaries” to be paid by him, “although their salaries, rental and running costs were funded by the Department of Social Development (DSD) at the beginning of every month.” DSD communication head Esther Lewis said: “The Department of Social Development takes allegations of mismanagement very seriously, and the claims will be investigated.” Cape Times
