To date, 1 172 513  tests have been conducted cumulatively. Breakthrough in Covid-19 therapeutics research Mkhize said the health department is excited that there has been an important breakthrough in one of the therapeutic trials for Covid-19 management. "The Recovery (Randomised Evaluation of Covid-19 thERapY) trial has published results on the therapeutic merits of low dose dexamethasone which are extremely promising and are easily implementable in our country." He added that dexamethasone is a well-known and widely used steroid which has potent anti-inflammatory properties. It is used in allergic reactions, asthma and other conditions where the inflammatory component of the disease needs to be controlled for better outcomes. "We are very pleased that the Ministerial Advisory Committee on Covid-19 has issued an advisory pertaining to the clinical applications of these breaking study results." * For the latest on the Covid-19 outbreak, visit IOL's special #Coronavirus page. ** If you think you have been exposed to the Covid-19 virus, please call the 24-hour hotline on 0800 029 999 or visit sacoronavirus.co.za
