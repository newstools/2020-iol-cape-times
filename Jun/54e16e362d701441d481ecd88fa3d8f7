“Drakenstein’s tourism sector has lost approximately R65m in income and has shed 700 jobs after two months of lockdown. “The total proposed budget for the 2020/2021 financial year amounts to R2.9 billion, comprising a R2.6bn operating and R216.97m capital budget. “To fund the capital projects, we will not take up any new external loans over the next five financial years. This will ensure that our current gearing ratio decreases to an estimated 67% in 2020/2021, and to an estimated 42.9% in the 2024/2025 financial year.” Meanwhile, a proposal for no salary increases for councillors or employees of the Drakenstein Municipality for the 2020/2021 financial year met with strong opposition from ANC councillor Thuso Mpulanyana. Mpulanyana caused a stir when he said the ANC’s 15 councillors on the 65-member council would oppose the plan as they had not been consulted. Patricia Mokoena of the DA, the Mayco member for corporate services, had submitted an agenda item for the council to support an application to the SA Local Government Bargaining Council exempting Drakenstein Municipality from implementing the Salary and Wage Collective Agreement. Mpulanyana said: “The matter should have been discussed unofficially before it was brought before the council.” Deputy mayor and financial services Mayco member Gert Combrink said: “It is morally wrong to implement the salary increases while businesses are closing down, people are losing their jobs and community members are at a loss for income." mwangi.githahu@inl.co.za Cape Argus
