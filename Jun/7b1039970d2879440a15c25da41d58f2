Included in these numbers are the admissions at our two completed temporary hospitals, the Hospital of Hope and the Khayelitsha MSF hospital," said Winde. "The Hospital of Hope has so far admitted a total of 45 people since it opened last week and 15 have already been discharged. The Khayelitsha hospital currently has 15 admissions. "Most people who contract Covid-19 will recover without the need for hospitalisation. However, a small percentage of people will require hospital care. "Our ICU admissions currently account for under 2% of all active cases. The majority of people who become seriously ill have been over the age of 55 or have one or more comorbidities, including hypertension, diabetes, HIV and heart, lung and kidney ailments. "This is why it is very important that we all work together to help protect the vulnerable. By staying home as much as possible, avoiding gatherings, wearing a mask, washing your hands, and keeping your distance when out in public you can not only prevent getting sick yourself, but you can also protect your loved ones and save lives."
