Cape Town – Several days of rain over the province have tipped the Cape metro’s dam levels to more than 80%, with three more days of downpours predicted for the week. The average dam level in the province has also increased to 62.2%, but the interior parts of the region, including the Karoo, remain in distress. “Dams filling to over 80% is a significant milestone for the City,” water and waste Mayco member Xanthea Limberg said. “Although there are still almost two months left of the traditionally rainy season, it looks like there is a good probability that we will go into spring/summer in a fairly strong position, especially considering continued low consumption by residents,” she said. Disaster risk spokesperson Charlotte Powell said there were no major incidents as a result of the rain.         Meanwhile, the Table Mountain Group (TMG) aquifer is producing its first yield of groundwater at the Steenbras well field. There are currently eight completed production boreholes, yielding almost 20 million litres per day. “To put this into context, 30 million litres per day is the equivalent of a daily water supply for around 200 000 people at current consumption levels of 125 litres of water per person, per day. “Alternatively, this would represent 16 days’ worth of water for the whole city, for every year of operation,” Limberg said. The Department of Water and Sanitation (DWS) welcomed the launch of the first underground water supply project from the TMG aquifer by the City. “The aquifer, which is believed to be the largest in the world at a depth of 710 metres below the ground, is a perfect model of how exploration of alternative water sources can go a long way to augment water supply in the face of climate change,” the department said.
