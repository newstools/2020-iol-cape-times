Cape Town – A taxi driver will appear in the Khayelitsha Magistrate's Court today for the murder of traffic officer Deon Sampson. Sampson, 46, was checking the licence disc on a taxi waiting in the queue at a Khayelitsha roadblock on Friday night when the driver accelerated, ran him over and dragged him along the road for nearly 200m before his body dislodged. Police spokesperson Noloyiso Rwexana said: “SAPS and Traffic Services held a vehicle checkpoint at Spine road when a taxi was stopped. The driver of the taxi suddenly drove off and the traffic officer was fatally injured. “The police gave chase and arrested a 38-year-old man. He will appear in the Khayelitsha Magistrate's court,” said Rwexana. Mayco member for safety and security JP Smith said that the City was shocked and saddened by the officer's death. “Officer Sampson was part of an integrated operation with SAPS, and while checking the licence disc on a taxi waiting in the queue at approximately 9.45pm, the driver accelerated, ran him over and dragged him along the road.         “The rest of the officers on scene chased after the vehicle, but the driver refused to stop. “They had to discharge several rounds at the vehicle before the driver was eventually apprehended off Oscar Mpetha Drive. It is alleged that he was under the influence of alcohol. However, that is no excuse. “What happened to Officer Sampson is horrific, and I call on the SAPS to expedite this investigation so that justice can be served. It cuts deep when we lose one of our own, but even more when the circumstances are as incomprehensible as (those that) transpired,” said Smith. Meanwhile, a traffic officer from George was shot and wounded by a motorist over the weekend, according to reports. It is understood 29-year-old Janneke Bergman pulled over the driver of a vehicle who was driving recklessly on the N2 near the Pacaltsdorp bridge and the driver shot at her, before fleeing the scene.
