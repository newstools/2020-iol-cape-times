Cape Town – The Restaurant Association of SA (Rasa) said it has been inundated with reports through social media of the illegal sale of alcohol at restaurants. Rasa chief executive Wendy Alberts said the alleged incidents only served to hamper their efforts in trying to convince the government to lift the ban on the sale of alcohol. “We are encouraging restaurants to stay compliant. We understand the economic impact the regulations have had on the industry but restaurants cannot break the law. “We are working hand in hand with the government to have the liquor ban lifted. ’’We’ve opened lines of communication. The only way we can ensure victory is by abiding by the law,” she said. Beer House founder Randolf Jorberg said since the alcohol ban, it had been difficult to operate and he was now staying with industry friends in Barcelona and looking for new business opportunities. “It’s a painful state of the industry and without alcohol Beer House is trading at under 10% of our regular turnover, bleeding cash. “That’s why I’m in Europe looking for new opportunities. My business existence in South Africa has ended,” he said. CBD ward councillor Dave Bryant said he was not aware of any specific restaurants selling alcohol. Cape Times
