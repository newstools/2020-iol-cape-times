Cape Town – The SA Human Rights Commission (SAHRC) has intervened in St Helena Bay, along the West Coast, where protests over housing turned violent this week. Disgruntled residents brought the area to a standstill on several occasions, blocking the only entry and exit road of a section of the area. Human Rights Commissioner Chris Nissen said the SAHRC was busy facilitating different meetings between various communities. “The community has been complaining about the housing crisis for a very long time now; people have been saying that they’ve been on the waiting list for many years. "There are some service delivery issues; we are looking to road-map how different communities can engage with municipalities to resolve some of those issues,” said Nissen. St Helena Bay ward 12 councillor Monde Makwetu said residents were demanding houses, as the last batch were built in 2002. Makwetu also alleged that racial tensions were heating up over land. “Last year, the mayor held more than three meetings with a smaller group of coloured communities that were not approved in RDP subsidies because their salaries exceeded the minimum amount...to qualify for housing. "These meetings were happening in the absence of me as a ward councillo, while being held in my ward the mayor made promises; now people are saying they are tired of empty promises,” he said. Saldanha Bay mayor Marius Koen said the issues related to representations on the beneficiary list. He said there was an active housing project, with 309 houses being built in Laingville. “It’s not the housing issue that’s the problem... the issue is the beneficiary list. "When I went to see them, (the problem) was housing, but when I had a face-to-face meeting, other issues popped up. "We request protesters to open roads so that the economy can return to normal,” said Koen. He added that they had met with the SAHRC. Police spokesperson Sergeant Noloyiso Rwexana said police would remain vigilant. Cape Times
