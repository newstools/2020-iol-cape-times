Cape Town – Described as an insult to indigenous people who had their ancestral land stolen, the Goringhaicona Khoi Khoin Traditional Indigenous Council is gearing up to appeal the R4 billion River Club redevelopment in Observatory, which has been given the go-head by the Western Cape Department of Environmental Affairs and Development Planning. Tauriq Jenkins, high commissioner of the Goringhaicona Khoena Council, said the proposed development on the Liesbeek River would occur on ancestral land that was stolen, fenced, and demarcated. “As a site of diversity and resistance against colonial conquest, the site holds an immensity of meaning for the living and the ancestors. “It is unfortunate to see ignored in the decision the thousands of people who objected, including the discontent expressed by reputable institutions in architecture, heritage, environmental agencies, and from the Khoi and San,” Jenkins said. The redevelopment of the River Club property into a mixed-use development is set to include shops, restaurants, offices, dwelling units and a hotel. Trustee and spokesperson for the Liesbeek Leisure Properties Trust, Jody Aufrichtig, said the development would provide "a range of socio-economic benefits for surrounding communities”. "The planned mixed-use development will be a significant boost to the economy and people of Cape Town in the aftermath of the national Covid-19 lockdown,” Aufrichtig said. Provincial spokesperson for the Environmental Affairs and Development Planning department, Rudolf van Jaarsveldt, said the department had thoroughly considered all comments during the environmental impact assessment process.
