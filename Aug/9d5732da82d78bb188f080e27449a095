Cape Town – The Independent Police Investigative Directorate (Ipid) and SA Human Rights Commission (SAHRC) will be investigating a police shooting that led to an 11-year-old boy being shot in the head. The boy was hit by a stray rubber bullet allegedly fired by police during protests in St Helena on the West Coast. Community activist Sammy Classen said protests over housing and land erupted on Thursday and continued on Friday when the boy was shot. He said residents were aggrieved by the way the Saldanha Bay municipality handled the distribution of land and plots for housing. Classen said the boy was shot while watching TV with his parents. “He is now fighting for his life at the Red Cross Children’s Hospital. The doctors say they are afraid to remove the bullet as it may put his life in danger.” Police spokesperson, André Traut, said Ipid was looking into it. “After our forces were withdrawn from the area, it was reported that an 11-year-old boy sustained a head wound. “It is yet to be established how the wound was inflicted. The circumstances and how the boy was injured are being investigated by Ipid.” SAHRC commissioner Chris Nissen said they would be visiting the area tomorrow. “It’s unacceptable that a young boy was injured. We will be going to visit the family and also engage with the community. “Police are trained and in dealing with public protests they could engage with the community and talk to them. Opening fire should be the last resort.” He said they also hoped to engage law enforcement agencies to get a resolution. Cape Times
