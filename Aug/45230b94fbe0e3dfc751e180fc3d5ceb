Cape Town – A 72-hour arrest plan has been launched for gunmen who shot and killed three people at the Khayelitsha taxi rank on Monday. Police spokesperson Novela Potelwa yesterday said the victims had visited the taxi rank after one of them was in an accident involving a taxi on Sunday. Two of the victims, aged 32 and 34, died at the scene, while a third died at hospital. The shooting on Monday also followed the murder of a well-known Mfuleni taxi owner who was shot dead while seated in his car on Sunday night. “Khayelitsha detectives are still scouring the crime scene where three people came under fire in Site C, Khayelitsha, on Monday afternoon. Two died at the scene and the third one upon arrival at a hospital. “It is alleged that the deceased had just met some taxi operators at the Kuwait taxi rank in Site C when two gunmen appeared and fired several shots at them. “The victims had visited the taxi rank after one of them was in an accident involving a taxi on Sunday,” Potelwa said. Ward councillor Ntomboxolo Kopman said residents were shocked by the incident. “The shootings in our area are not an everyday thing. It shocked us all that it happened at the taxi rank, because we know the taxi owners and drivers as people who fight crime and violence in our communities. “The matter needs to be thoroughly looked at because this is a criminal act and whoever killed the people should face jail time,” Kopman said.
