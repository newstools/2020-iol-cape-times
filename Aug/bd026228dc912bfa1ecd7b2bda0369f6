Cape Town – The St Helena Bay community is mourning the death of Leo Williams who was allegedly struck by a rubber bullet fired by police during protests. The 9-year-old’s body was due to undergo a post-mortem yesterday for further information on the bullet that killed him, according to his family. Leo was shot in the head during a protest in St Helena Bay two weeks ago. It is claimed he was struck by a rubber bullet fired by police while sitting in the living room of his home. Leo was taken to the Red Cross War Memorial Children's Hospital and was in ICU until the machines keeping him alive were turned off on Monday. Family spokesperson Thyrone Williams said he was with the family when the doctors turned off the machines at 2.30pm. “The family is grateful for all the support and prayers they received in this difficult time. They are very heartbroken and this is still very surreal to them. The funeral will be next week.” The Independent Police Investigative Directorate has changed its investigation from attempted murder to murder. Community leader Sammy Claasen said they hoped the family received justice. “This is one of our democracy's most cruel acts of cold-blooded murder.” Cape Times
