Cape Town – Nine-year-old Leo Williams continues to fight for his life after he was shot in the head with a rubber bullet, allegedly by the police. Leo is in a critical condition at the Red Cross War Memorial Children’s Hospital after he was shot during a protest in St Helena Bay. He was sitting in his living room when he was struck. Family spokesperson Thyrone Williams said doctors have already turned off one machine and were looking at turning off the remaining machines keeping Leo alive. “When we went there on Sunday we were waiting for the doctors to call before they switch off the machines, we went back (on Thursday) the doctors were saying he was still fighting with everything he’s got and we need to remain positive and pray for him.” He said the family was devastated by what happened and were too emotional to speak about the ordeal. “I know Leo very well, he is friends with my son who is 10. He (Leo) is a very energetic person and he likes to play. He is a lovely guy and the community loves him. ’’My son keeps asking me when he can go to play with Leo and it’s difficult to explain to him what has happened. He again asked to see Leo and I got so emotional.” Williams said the community banded together to help Leo’s family in any way they could. The police said they had already left the area when Leo was shot, but the matter is under investigation by the Independent Police Investigative Directorate. A community leader who asked not to be named said they feared anger from the community should Leo not make it. Cape Times
