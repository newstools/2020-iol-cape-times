Cape Town – The Independent Police Investigative Directorate (Ipid) is probing a shoot-out involving a police officer and alleged hijackers in which a 12-year-old Philippi boy was caught in their crossfire. Sisonke Vuthela from Ramaphosa informal settlement in Brown’s Farm was hit in the neck by a stray bullet while running for cover, about 400m away from his home on Friday afternoon. According to the 12-year-old’s uncle, Simpiwe Vuthela, Sisonke had been helping to wash a car when the shooting occurred. “Residents who were there during the incident reported that the police officer’s car was being washed and he was inside the car when the suspects fired shots in an attempt to scare him and hijack the car. “When the gunshots went off, people including Sisonke ran for cover, but he was unfortunately hit when the police officer allegedly fired back at the suspects. He died on the way to hospital,” he said. Vuthela said the officer would sometimes go to the mini car wash and let the youngsters wash his car. “We don’t want to say much at this point. The family is still trying to come to terms with the heartbreaking incident, especially his mom and grandmother. "They have been hit hard. We are hoping that justice will be served,” he said. The family is hoping to lay Sisonke to rest at a funeral in the Eastern Cape this weekend. Police spokesperson Andrè Traut said: “The investigation regarding the death of the 12-year-old boy is being conducted by the Independent Police Investigative Directorate (Ipid) due to the possible involvement of an SAPS member.” Ipid spokesperson Ndileka Cola said: “Ipid is investigating the death of a child as a result of police action, this is after an incident that occurred in Ramaphosa Informal Settlement in Browns Farm.” Cape Times
