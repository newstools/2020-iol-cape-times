Cape Town – Langa and Khayelitsha residents tipped their trash into the streets yesterday as they protested against a new waste-collection contract award. Sources told the Cape Times some residents were blocking the new company from entering the areas, as they wanted another company to have the job. Langa ward councillor Samkelo John alleged the protest was politically motivated. “The residents blocked the newly-appointed company from operating because they prefer another company. In terms of the supply chain management, it is not acceptable that people are chosen because they are being favoured by certain individuals. People submit tender documents and undergo the legal processes in order to be appointed,” said John. TR section ward councillor Ntomboxolo Kopman said they were looking into the issue. “We understand the residents’ frustration and we will engage with them on what processes are taken when awarding a tender. “We can’t stop service delivery, especially the waste collection, because it has to do with one’s health. It is important during this pandemic period that residents’ health is well taken care of,” said Kopman. Human settlements Mayco member Malusi Booi said the City was aware of the incident. “There is one company which is offering services in blocks A, D, E and H. Community members have stopped a second company from working at blocks B, C, F and G, which are on the other side of the road. “Services provided by these companies include the cleaning of passages, toilets, staircases, grounds and refuse huts. The community is not allowing the company to work and it is, therefore, unable to render services. “Community members are not allowed to interfere in these services. Community members should also not cause greater harm by tipping over bins and causing hygiene issues. “Work should continue and the City will look into any matters raised,” said Booi. Cape Times
