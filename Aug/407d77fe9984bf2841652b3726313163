Cape Town – The refurbishment of the iconic St James Beach bathing boxes, several of which burned down in a fire at the weekend, forms part of the City’s coastal optimisation plan. The City said it had drafted a proposal for the refurbishment of the famed colourful boxes before three were burnt down and two more partially damaged in a fire in the early hours of Saturday. Mayco member for spatial planning and environment Marian Nieuwoudt said the City had already drafted a proposal for the refurbishment of the beach boxes as part of its coastal optimisation plan as they were in a poor state due to a combination of wear and tear and vandalism. “The City shares the public’s view of the importance of these beach boxes as an iconic and historical part of the St James landscape and assures the public that they will remain part of the St James landscape in the future. “The challenging maintenance and security issues associated with these bathing boxes are currently being revisited and addressed through the City’s Coastal Optimisation process. ’’Proposed solutions have been developed and will be communicated to the public once endorsed by the City,” she said. Nieuwoudt said the City would do its utmost to attain a meaningful and measured balance in retaining some aspects of the existing coastal identity into the future. City Fire and Rescue spokesperson Jermaine Carelse said: “At about 1am on the morning of August 8, Law Enforcement officers found three of the iconic St James Beach bathing boxes well alight. ’’The fire was extinguished by the fire department. Three boxes were completely gutted and two partially damaged. The cause of the fire is unknown.” Cape Times
