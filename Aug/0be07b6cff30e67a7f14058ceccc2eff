Cape Town – Calm has been restored in Delft following violent protests which led to the torching of three Golden Arrow buses and the closure of the busy R300 and the N2 highway. The protesters, according to Community Policing Forum chairperson (CPF) Charles George, were backyarders who have lost income and say they can’t afford to pay rent. “Now they are building shacks on any land they can find. We don’t condone the violence and we are working on finding ways to end the violence,” George said. Golden Arrow spokesperson Bronwen Dyke-Beyer said each bus cost about R2.4 million and some of the costs would ultimately have to be passed on to passengers. While no injuries were reported during the recent attacks, two of the buses were gutted, and the third was salvageable. Last week another Golden Arrow bus was set alight near Philippi and three drivers attacked. The company has called on the SAPS and the authorities to intervene and keep its drivers and passengers safe. Police spokesperson Andrè Traut said law and order had been restored to the area and the affected roads were reopened. “Our forces will remain in the area on high alert to maintain the peace. Cases of public violence have been registered for the torched vehicles and arrests are yet to be made,” he said. Meanwhile, the Belhar fire crew had to be sent home and the station closed for the rest of the night after a narrow escape when they came under attack in Delft South on Thursday. The crew was responding to an emergency call just before 8pm of a truck that had been set alight in Delft South where residents were experiencing load shedding. They had met their SAPS escort at Hindle Road, but just as they were nearing the incident, the crew came under attack, with a brick hurled at the windscreen. Additional protection was called and the crew had to leave the volatile area. Cape Times
