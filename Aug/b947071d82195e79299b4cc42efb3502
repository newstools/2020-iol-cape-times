Cape Town – Police are investigating a double murder and four cases of attempted murder after two women were killed and four others wounded in a shooting at a residence in Philippi. Yesterday, the Cape Times visited the Mbeshu family, who were packing up their relatives’ belongings under the protection of a police escort, as they planned to move out of the area. Six members of the family were shot on Saturday night. Two of them died at the scene, and the four others are being treated in hospital. Nomazwi Mbeshu, victim Nandipha Mbeshu’s sister, described the situation as heartbreaking and devastating. “Last week, there was a car parked outside with six men in it, who were looking for my sister. Fortunately she was not in the house. “After work I usually visit her, but on the day of the incident, I did not feel like it. She called that night to check up on me, like she usually does. "Two minutes after I spoke to her, I heard my daughter crying, telling me that my sister had been shot. I could not believe it, that the person I just spoke to has been gunned down,” Nomazwi Mbeshu said. Police spokesperson Novela Potelwa said: “Samora Machel detectives are investigating a double murder and attempted murders after two women were fatally wounded at a residence in Samora Machel at about 8pm on Saturday. “The deceased women, aged 33 and 25, were with four other women who sustained gunshot wounds and were admitted to hospital.
