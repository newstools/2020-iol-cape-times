Cape Town – The Independent Police Investigative Directorate (Ipid) is investigating a case of police brutality after a Moorreesburg man died while in police custody. Manfred Lewis, 34, died yesterday after he had allegedly been assaulted by police after being arrested earlier this week. Ipid spokesperson Ndileka Cola said the investigation was at a “sensitive stage”. “This incident has been reported to Ipid; the investigation thereof has resumed. The directorate is communicating with the affected family. “Our dedicated team of investigators is handling this matter, which is still at a sensitive stage. ’’Ipid would like to appeal to you to please allow the investigation process to unfold. At an appropriate stage, the developments will be communicated,” said Cola. Family spokesperson advocate Vernice Bergins said Lewis’ family was further traumatised when his mother arrived at Moorreesburg police station yesterday morning and was not allowed to identify or view the body of her son. “His mother was informed about the incident, but when she got to the police station to see the body of her son, she was denied access to do so. Police told her that the body is being taken to Malmesbury. “These atrocious acts can no longer be tolerated. It is alleged by one of the people that the worst form of police brutality took place. They assaulted this person horribly, and as a result he died,” said Bergins. Bergins said the matter was reported to the SA Human Rights Commission . “We cannot allow these types of atrocities to happen. We also cannot be the voice of the people, but yet, we close up these types of news events - especially in small rural towns where they are seen as the forgotten people,” said Bergins. Moorreesburg Action Group spokesperson Bronwin Adonis said Lewis was believed to have been a soft target of alleged police assault during the lockdown. Cape Times
