Cape Town – Children are suspected of being behind the shooting of a dog with a pellet gun in Mitchells Plain last week. The Animal Welfare Society (AWS) said the shots narrowly missed the dog Blackie’s spine. Organisation spokesperson Allan Perrins said: “Evidence suggests that the shooter took deliberate aim, intent on causing Blackie maximum pain and suffering, with one pellet penetrating Blackie’s back, narrowly missing his spine. “Another hit his right front leg, leaving him temporarily incapacitated and reeling in pain as they casually sought out their next victim.” He added there was ample evidence proving children who are cruel to and hurt animals sometimes grow up to become killers and abusers. “With this fact in mind, we need your help to track them down and hold them accountable before they can get an opportunity to hurt and kill again.” Blackie’s owner, Valerie Julies said she was angry when she found out her dog was shot with a pellet gun. Julies said she noticed Blackie was limping, became concerned and decided to take him in for help. “When they called me to say they removed pellets from his foot and hit his shoulder, I was very angry. “I said it must be children that did this. “This is why I wish schools would reopen. “The children don’t know what to do with themselves. “They are the ones that walk around with pellet guns in the area.” Blackie is safe at home after theatre staff at the AWS removed the pellets. Julies said she was happy to have her pet back home. To report animal cruelty, contact the AWS at 021 692 2626 or visit their website: http://awscape.org.za Cape Times
