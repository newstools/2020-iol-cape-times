Cape Town – The Kraaifontein family of police officer Sandiswa Rum say they are relieved to be reunited with the 22-year-old who was reported missing this week. Police spokesperson Andrè Traut confirmed yesterday that Rum had been found late the previous night, but did not elaborate on the circumstances leading to her disappearance. “As the family we are glad she is back during this evil time, where people really get kidnapped and are not found,” a spokesperson for the family said. “At this stage, she has not shared where she was or what happened. Rum, employed at the Nyanga police station, was reported missing after she was last seen leaving work on Tuesday morning. Traut had said Rum had knocked off from her night shift and never made it home after getting into an unknown car. “Investigations have revealed that Constable Rum left the station at about 5am with an unknown person(s) in a white vehicle, of which, the make and registration number is currently unknown. “Interviews were conducted with various colleagues and family members in an attempt to trace the constable. The member’s cellphone is still switched off,” Traut had said on Wednesday. Her uncle, Simon Nkanunu, said Rum’s mother reported her missing at the Kraaifontein police station after she failed to return home and her phone was switched off. The distraught family received a call on Wednesday afternoon and heard the 22-year-old screaming for help before the phone call ended. “This has never happened before, and she is close with her mother and tells her everything. “We would like to thank everyone who assisted in sharing that she was missing,” said Nkanunu.
