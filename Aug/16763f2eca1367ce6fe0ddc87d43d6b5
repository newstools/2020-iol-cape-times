Cape Town - In an emotional send-off on Tuesday, human rights activist advocate Hishaam Mohamed was laid to rest by family, friends and freedom stalwarts. Mohamed passed away suddenly after suffering a heart attack on Monday night, and according to Muslim rites, was buried yesterday. His brother and family spokesperson Saliem Mohamed said he left behind a distinguished legacy. “All the condolences come with a story, a story of his service to the country. This is the legacy that my brother leaves,” Saliem said. Mohamed was a lawyer and an activist, and dedicated his life to the Struggle for freedom, justice and human rights. Advocate Venice Burgins, who worked with Mohamed at the Legal Monitoring Security Task Team of the ANC, said she was shattered to hear about her colleague’s passing. “It is a great loss to the legal fraternity. We send off a cadre of the movement - a selfless servant of the people at grass-roots level. All we can do is not to let his legacy of access to justice to the most vulnerable die; we must continue the fight to bring justice to the doorsteps of the most vulnerable,” said Burgins. National Association of Democratic Lawyers national general secretary Nolitha Jali expressed their deep sense of loss while remembering Mohamed as a stalwart and comrade.
