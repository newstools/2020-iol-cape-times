Cape Town – Boys Town residents in Old Crossroads are reeling after an active member of the community was killed in her home in what was alleged to be a hit. According to reports, three unknown men stormed into Nombulelo Mayekiso’s home on Sunday and one of them fired multiple shots at the mother of five before leaving her for dead. A community leader close to the family, who asked to remain anonymous out of fear for their life, said residents were heartbroken and still trying to come to terms with the incident. “The community is saddened because the victim was an active member of the community who was vocal. "What is even more sad is that she had just moved into her new home and didn't even live long enough to enjoy it,” the leader said. Police spokesperson Noloyiso Rwexana said: “A case of murder has been opened for investigation following an incident that occurred at 8.45pm at New Houses, in Boys Town, Nyanga. "According to information, police attended a shooting incident at the address and upon their arrival were informed that unidentified suspects had shot and wounded a 38-year-old female. “The victim was transported to a medical facility, where she died. The motive for this shooting is under investigation. No one has been arrested so far.” The murder comes a day after two members of a Philippi family were murdered and four injured in a shooting on Saturday. Two women, who were members of the Mbeshu family, aged 33 and 25, died at the scene while four others were transported to hospital. The motive for the attack is being investigated and no arrests have been made. In another unrelated incident, Mfuleni mother Nomaphelo Kebe, 45, her daughter Wendy, 23, and son Sive, 17, were killed just before their family vehicle, which was later found burnt, was stolen.
