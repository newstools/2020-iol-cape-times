Cape Town – Yet another cyclist being attacked and robbed has prompted the Pedal Power Association (PPA) to call for added safety measures in incident hot spots. Association chairperson Stephen Hayward said after a cyclist was attacked along Spaanschemat Road, Tokai, yesterday morning, they would be approaching the municipality to erect warning signs for cyclists. “This is about the sixth or seventh incident in that vicinity that we are aware of. “The incidents happen at about the same time and the criminals are brazen. “We will be going to the municipality in the area to request signage to warn or alert riders to criminal activity. We hope that this will help,” said Hayward. Police spokesperson Andre Traut said the incident happened at 7.30am yesterday. “A 65-year-old cyclist was attacked by three suspects at the Tokai Circle and robbed of his bicycle. “The victim was admitted to hospital after he was struck on the head by the suspects, who are yet to be arrested. The circumstances are being investigated,” said Traut. Hayward said criminals often hid behind bushes. “We urge cyclists to remain alert when using that route. We have brought this to the attention of Steenberg SAPS, but victims of the crime are urged to report all incidents of hijacking or robbery so that the SAPS is able to build up a profile in the area.” Anyone with information can anonymously contact Crime Stop at 086 001 0111 or SMS Crime Line at 32211.
