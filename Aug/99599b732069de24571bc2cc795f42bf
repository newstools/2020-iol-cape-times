Cape Town – The head of plumbing and acting chief of building maintenance at Groote Schuur Hospital, Martin Ronne, says he moved into the hospital’s hostel when the Covid-19 pandemic struck to access constant health and safety support. Ronne, of Pinelands, has worked at the hospital for six years. He said he and his team had been overwhelmingly busy with the Covid-19 crisis. “It’s a lot more work now, the guys are all under pressure. I even moved into the hostel next to the hospital so I could be available all the time and overnight. I would rather be here and keep my family at home safe. I go home and see them on the weekends,” he said. His team has to frequently service the air conditioning system at the hospital as the virus can live on surfaces. Ronne said after letting go of eight students who were helping them on account of the pandemic, they were now down to a team of three plumbers and three handymen, and duties were piling up. “With Covid we have to speedily change the wards. First, we inspect and see what plumbing and building needs to be done, such as painting, dry-walling between beds to create shields, or installing rails for curtains to create privacy,” he said. Ronne said more now needed to be done, such as changing conventional taps to elbow action for the virus. “Carpets have to be pulled out because the virus can live in the carpets, so we install vinyl rather, which is easier to clean. We also had to make changes to the taps and extra basins to wash hands, and then we still have our daily challenges such as blockages, pinholes in piping, and theft of pipes is an ongoing issue,” he said. Despite fears of contracting the virus, Ronne said he had to be on standby so he could react quicker to any emergencies. He lauded their head of department, Denton Smith, for his assistance. Hospital spokesperson Alaric Jacobs said they were thankful for the contributions of every staff member. Cape Times
