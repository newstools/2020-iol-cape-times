Cape Town – In a bid to raise money for underfunded schools, Matthew Kruger, ambassador for the charity One Heart for Kids, will put himself to the test when he sets out to walk 100km in 24 hours. On his birthday, Kruger will take up the challenge, which will see him walk over three mountain passes from August 21-22. He aims to raise much-needed funds for 18 primary schools in the Western Cape and neighbouring Eastern Cape. “I thought people that are fortunate enough always get things on their birthdays, and I also want to get things, but I thought this would be a good time to give,” said Kruger He said the idea for the walk came from seeing that in the course of their lives many people walked long distances. “I thought it would be worth it to do something that is seen as normal to raise as much as we can,” he said. “We want to use it (walk) as a way to raise awareness about these schools and assist them. This is something I have never done before and it will be a challenge. "I am hoping that if all goes well we can actually turn it into a (regular event) and have athletes and others join in next year.” The upcoming event will raise funds for the provision of internationally accredited reading materials in the underfunded schools as well as for food parcels for families in need and educational toys and teaching aids. Kruger will take off on August 21 outside Worcester and aims to keep going through the night and arrive at AF Louw Primary School in Stellenbosch before 1pm on August 22. Support Kruger online by walking one or more kilometres virtually in time with him as he progresses throughout the night and streams the challenge hourly on the One Heart For Kids Facebook page.
