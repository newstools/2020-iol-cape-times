Cape Town - Land Reform and Rural Development Minister Thoko Didiza has met with the Chief Registrar of Deeds and all provincial registrars to put a concrete plan in place to address challenges of backlogs in all deeds offices. This is according to Western Cape Finance and Economic Opportunities MEC David Maynier who said that they welcomed the news. The plan includes the implementation of a number of emergency measures including: “This announcement follows calls from myself and industry bodies to address the repeated and, at times unnecessary, closure of the Cape Town deeds office which is having a considerable negative impact on the property and real estate industry in the Western Cape. “Our Department of Economic Development and Tourism stands ready to advise on the implementation of workplace safety measures at the deeds office, and I look forward to engaging with Minister Didiza on the matter should it be required,” said Maynier. “The smooth running of processes like deeds registration are key to the success of investments in the economy and new investments are of course a vital aspect of economic recovery and growth in the Western Cape, and so we look forward to these plans being implemented immediately.” Cape Argus
