Cape Town ‚Äì Snow has blanketed many parts of South Africa the past two days, with social media especially highlighting the effects of the cold front that made landfall on Monday afternoon in the south-western and Eastern Cape. Among the more spectacular was a video recorded near Uniondale, a small town in the Little Karoo in the Western Cape, where a car can be seen making its way in a countryside that resembles a winter wonderland thick in snow.         It was also the case in Avontuur, outside Joubertina, at Misgundand at Twee Riviere in the Eastern Cape. The SA Weather Service had also predicted ‚Äúdisruptive snowfalls‚Äù over the high-lying grounds of the Cape Winelands, Central Karoo and Garden Route districts of the Western Cape as well as Karoo Hoogland in the Northern Cape. Parts of Lesotho have also been transformed into a white landscape.

Snow even fell in Bloemfontein and Kimberley. Videos uploaded by ReenvalSA on Twitter depict snow on the Swartberg mountain range between Oudtshoorn and Prince Albert in the Western Cape and reportedly for the first time in nine years on the Rooiberge at Opsoek (between Calitzdorp and Ladismith).     Snow has fallen over large areas of the Langkloof in the Eastern Cape. For the first time in many years the snow has come down to ground level. Farmers welcome the rain and snow as the area still crippled by drought.

The ‚Äúwhite Christmas decorations‚Äô‚Äô were also spotted on the Tsitsikama and Outeniqua mountain ranges along the Garden Route, but a video that surfaced of ‚Äô‚Äôsnow‚Äô‚Äô on Table Mountain was more a case of sleet.

As always, the run-off from the snow is good news for dams.     #snow  in Queenstown.
