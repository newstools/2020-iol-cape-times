Cape Town – The Cape of Good Hope SPCA is investigating Woodstock police for allegedly being involved in a hit-and-run incident in the area during which a cat was run over and killed. The incident was caught on CCTV footage and shows a police van running over a cat and driving off, the organisation said. The footage was brought to their attention by community members. “In the video it shows how the police vehicle drives over the cat as it runs across the road; the vehicle slows down and fails to stop and assist the injured animal. We have been informed that the cat unfortunately succumbed to its injuries. “Our inspectors are busy investigating the matter and action will be taken in terms of the Animals Protection Act,” said the organisation’s spokesperson, Belinda Abraham. The Cape of Good Hope SPCA urged the public to report animal cruelty by calling its team on 021 700 4158/9 or after hours on 083 326 1604. Police spokesperson Andre Traut said: “An official complaint is yet to be reported to SAPS regarding the matter.” Cape Times
