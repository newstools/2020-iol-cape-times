Cape Town – The Golden Arrow Bus Service (GABS) is offering a R200 000 reward for any information that will lead to the arrests of those behind the recent torching of its buses. Five buses have been torched in less than a week, with the latest incident leading to two buses set alight yesterday during a protest between New Eisleben and Govan Mbeki roads in Philippi. Community Policing Forum (CPF) chairperson Melikhaya Gadeni said the protest was for service delivery. The latest incident follows the torching of three other buses at the weekend, on the N2 and R300 near Delft and Nyanga. Golden Arrow spokesperson Bronwen Dyke-Beyer said the buses were gutted. “Golden Arrow is extremely concerned about the ongoing arson attacks which have resulted in five destroyed buses in the last two weeks. ’’The SAPS are constitutionally mandated to investigate these crimes and bring perpetrators to book and we plead with them to intervene decisively. “Golden Arrow will also be offering a R200 000 reward for any information, including video footage of perpetrators setting the buses alight, which will lead to the arrest and conviction of the perpetrators,” she said. Dyke-Beyer added the company would do everything it could to ensure the safety of drivers and passengers and assist SAPS in its efforts to arrest the culprits and put an end to these acts. Police spokesperson Noloyiso Rwexana said Philippi East police were investigating a case of public violence and malicious damage to property following the incidents in the early hours of yesterday. “According to reports, a group of about 70 people from Siyangena informal settlement participated in a service delivery protest on Eisleben Road. ’’They blocked the road, two buses were torched and motorists were attacked. No one has been arrested and police are monitoring the situation,” she said. Anyone with information can contact the service on 021 507 8800 or email information@gabs.co.za Cape Times
