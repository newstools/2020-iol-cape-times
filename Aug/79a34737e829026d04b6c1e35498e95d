Cape Town – Remembered by her family as a woman of virtue who was a mother to all, Bonteheuwel’s oldest resident, Dorothy Maud, died peacefully at the age of 102. “MaDoris”, as she was fondly known, died on Monday at her home in Bonteheuwel where she lived with her family for the past 58 years. Her granddaughter, Rene Jumat, said the family would not be the same without her, and they would try to keep her legacy and teachings alive. “In all her years she never had any underlying conditions until about a month ago, when she was diagnosed with a bladder infection. She was a strong-willed woman who took care of others. “She enjoyed going outside for some air and walking around in the neighbourhood, catching up and seeing how the neighbours were doing,” she said. She said the family would always remember Maud for how she gave her all in everything that she did. “She would give her last cent to those in need and then say ‘the Lord will provide’. Mama was a firm believer in God,” she said. Maud was born on August 20 in 1918 in Goodwood, where she had spent half of her life. Being the eldest of three children, she worked on and off as a domestic worker to help her mother provide for her siblings. Her passing marked the end of a first generation of five, leaving behind her 11 children, 31 grandchildren, 69 great grandchildren and 21 great-great grandchildren. Maud will be buried on August 15. Speaking on the community’s loss, councillor Angus McKenzie described her as a stalwart and a legend. “MaDoris will be remembered for many, many years, her story will be told, her life detailed and experiences shared. “A large part of Bonteheuwel has left us, while it is sad as a family, Bonteheuwel is proud of maDoris,” he said.
