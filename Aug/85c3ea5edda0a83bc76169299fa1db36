Colleen Gaskin is one of the nominees in our Women’s Month #SheIsMyRock campaign. Read more about her: Colleen is a nurse at a psychiatric hospital in Mitchells Plain and as a healthcare professional is on the frontline of the Covid-19 pandemic. She works long and hard hours to make sure her patients feel cared for, supported and safe. “She is such an inspiration to me because she has lost her son to cancer and is always spreading awareness about it in her community. She is such a selfless person, serving meals and wisdom to the vulnerable in her area,” says her niece. “She is great example of what a strong woman is. She is a hero in the frontline of the pandemic and plays her role so gracefully. My aunt is simply amazing.” * This Women’s Month, IOL in collaboration with the African News Agency, are calling on our readers, corporate partners and staff to nominate a woman who embodies the spirit of the women who took part in the 1956 march on the Union Buildings, by empowering and uplifting her community, fellow women or industry. The #SheIsMyRock nominee will be featured on IOL and you could stand a chance of winning an awesome gift for her thanks to our sponsors Dove, JC le Roux and Sorbet. To enter, email us at iolcompetitions@inl.co.za or Whatsapp to 0745573535, include a picture of the inspirational woman in your life and tell us why she is your rock. Text, audio and video entries will be accepted.
