Cape Town – The City of Cape Town has condemned the attempted hijacking of a Dial-a-Ride (DAR) vehicle in Crossroads which took place on Wednesday morning. The City said the incident, which took place at about 5:35am, left the driver shaken and the City’s vulnerable ride users stranded. “A Dial-a-Ride (DAR) vehicle on route to collect passengers for work was almost hijacked, fortunately the driver managed to escape unharmed. “This is not the first time that criminals have targeted this service that is intended to provide public transport to some of the most vulnerable in our communities,” said Mayco member for Transport, Felicity Purchase. Purchase said, in July, two passengers and a driver sustained injuries after a DAR vehicle was stoned in Khayelitsha. “I am appalled by these violent attacks on City services, which are making it difficult to keep on delivering essential services to our most vulnerable residents. It is highly upsetting to see our residents who cannot use conventional public transport left stranded by criminals who are constantly attacking this service. “This cannot be allowed to continue and I appeal to Capetonians to please help us apprehend the perpetrators and bring them to book,” she said. “I also want to commend the driver for his driving skills that helped him escape unharmed. He is visibly shaken and receiving counselling. We will continue to live up to our commitment of delivering excellent basic services, despite the challenges.” Cape Argus
