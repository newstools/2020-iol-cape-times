Cape Town – A 19-year-old Kraaifontein woman has been arrested after a gun used in an alleged gang shooting that claimed the life of 11-year-old Duran Visagie was found buried under her wendy house. She and two other teens arrested in connection with the shooting are expected to appear in Blue Downs Magistrate’s Court today. Duran was hit by a stray bullet in the head last Tuesday when rival gangs allegedly opened fire on each other. His death follows that of 6-year-old Gaylin Cupido, also in the area. Gaylin was killed in July by a stray bullet that hit her in the chest while she was out walking with her mother, brother and aunt. According to her grandfather, Piet Visagie, Duran was on his way home from a shop near his parents’ house in Joseph Avenue in Scottsdene when he was shot. “We found him lying on the pavement in the street and rushed him to a nearby hospital, where he fought hard for his life. Unfortunately, he was declared brain dead on Tuesday night and on Wednesday morning the machines that kept him alive had to be switched off,” he said. The Grade 5 pupil at Brooklands Primary School in Northpine enjoyed sports and was described as having a big heart. Police spokesperson FC Van Wyk said on Friday, Anti-Gang Unit (AGU) detectives conducted a tracing operation in Kraaifontein following information regarding suspects wanted in connection with the case, which had changed from attempted murder to murder. “The members arrested two suspects aged 17 and 18. After thoroughly questioning the suspects the members received information regarding the whereabouts of the murder weapon,” he said. Van Wyk said the AGU members searched the residence of the girlfriend of a suspect in Yvonne Street where they found a 9mm Norinco pistol with 26 rounds hidden underneath the wendy house. “The girlfriend, who is 19 years old, was also arrested for the possession of an unlicensed firearm and ammunition,” he said.
