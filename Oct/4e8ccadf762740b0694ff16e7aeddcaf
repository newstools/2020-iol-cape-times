Cape Town – The government will embark on a programme to get people to move off rail track land to make way for crucial rail operations in Philippi. In Phillipi, Eyadini informal settlement residents have been occupying the land for more than two years. Prasa spokesperson Zinobulali Mihi said: “The moving and relocation of the residents from the land will be a government-led programme as the challenges also require consideration of other issues which are of government focus. “The minister of transport has already alluded to this process on a number of occasions. ’’Therefore, when intergovernmental plans have been completed, the government will be in a position to share the plans publicly, which will most certainly include the where and the when,” Mihi said. Prasa started dealing with settlement challenges about three years ago, she added. “It escalated towards the end of last year and took a different turn during the national lockdown period from March this year. “Prasa is aware of the structures that have been illegally built in the rail reserve in Philippi,” she said. The residents living on the tracks have said they want basic services. Resident Nomatshatshu Ntlapo said they occupied the land because they had no other choice. “We can’t afford to pay rent money and I have been unemployed for a very long time – even now I am still searching for work. At times I get odd jobs which don’t pay enough for me to survive.” Malusi Booi, Mayco member for human settlements, said the land belonged to Prasa. “Anonymous tip-offs are welcome. Residents can give anonymous tip-offs if they are aware of illegal activity that is taking place, that has happened or is still to happen. Please call 112 from a cellphone (toll free) and 107 from a landline or 021 480 7700 for emergencies,” said Booi. Cape Times
