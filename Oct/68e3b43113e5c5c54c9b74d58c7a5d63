Cape Town – The City has denied claims that it raided and confiscated building structures of Lansdowne homeless people who have been living next to the train station for more than a decade. According to local activist Pamela Tosh, law enforcement officers ransacked the place occupied by more than 100 people on Monday. She claimed it was the third time the City sent its officers to “harass” the homeless, who were left scrambling for shelter. “The officers fined them R500 for informal trading, confiscated their belongings and shelter materials including cardboard and plastics. “I don’t understand where they are expected to get that amount of money. These are people who have children and have been living there for more than for more than 15 years. “In the cold month of August, the community was forced to endure the intimidation under unfair circumstances, with no solutions presented. “This was not the first place for the homeless to be raided; in some cases, personal belongings including identity documents were lost, meaning they cannot get grant money,” said Tosh. The City’s law enforcement spokesperson, Wayne Dyason, said officers acted on numerous complaints from residents in the area. “Fines were issued for consumption of alcohol in a public space, littering in the park, for trading and causing an obstruction and for an illegal fire. “Law enforcement did not remove any building materials or belongings,” said Dyason. Last year, the court barred the City from harassing or abusing homeless people or interfering with or confiscating their personal property. Lucien Lewin, a director at Marshall Dingley, representing the homeless, said: “It is shocking to hear that the City’s law enforcement continues to harass people. It means they have disregarded the court interdict.” Municipal executive director for safety and security Richard Bosman said the City was appealing against the court order and the appeal was not opposed.
