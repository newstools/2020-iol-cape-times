Cape Town – The comment period for the City’s climate change strategy has been extended by a month. The public now has until October 30 to comment on the draft strategy, after the City said the period had been extended because of its importance, and to give residents more time to comment. In the draft policy, the City says Cape Town faces a number of climatic changes, including a significant decrease in mean annual rainfall, more frequent and intense heat waves, an increase in wind strength, a rise in mean sea level and increased coastal erosion. “The City will take active steps to expand zero carbon electricity provision in both the retail and supply sectors through direct procurement from independent power producers. ’’This will enable distributed generation, tariff and business model development and technical preparation for an inverter-based grid,” the draft reads. “In the long term, the City aims to support the development of a hydrogen economy that can supply molecular fuel for industry, transport fuel for heavy vehicles and storage for curtailed wind and solar capacity.” Submit comments via email ClimateChange.Enquiries@capetown. gov.za or online www.capetown.gov. za/haveyoursay
