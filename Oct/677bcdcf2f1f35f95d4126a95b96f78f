CAPE TOWN – Western Cape Finance and Economic Opportunities MEC David Maynier says there were some positive notes from the Finance Minister Tito Mboweni’s Medium-term Budget Policy Statement (MTBPS), although he decried the bailout to state-owned South African Airways (SAA). Maynier noted that commitments to immediate food relief for poor households, support for early childhood development centres and support for job creation initiatives through the Provincial Roads Maintenance Programme were a plus. “But at the end of the day, the bailout to SAA is unjustifiable and simply wrong,” he said. Maynier said what was clear was that the provincial budget has been cut by a further R1.47 billion in this financial year in the Western Cape. “What is worse, is that our biggest fear was confirmed – provincial budgets have been cut to fund the R10.5 billion bailout of SAA. “Which means that the bailout for SAA will clearly compromise our healthcare services and the well-being and dignity of those living in the Western Cape by defunding critical projects that provide food security, that support ownership of property and land transformation and that create jobs in the Western Cape. “Where will the national government draw the line when it comes to SOEs? By opening this door, National Treasury has opened the door to further bailouts which can now only come at the expense of the safety, dignity and jobs of those living in the Western Cape and South Africa.” To fund this bailout, the Western Cape provincial budget has been cut by R86.61 million in this financial year through cuts to conditional grants as follows: Maynier also expressed concern at the decision by National Treasury to move from a three-year to a five-year debt stabilisation path which he said meant that there was an elevated risk of a debt default over the medium term in South Africa.
