Cape Town - The trio accused of kidnapping two Chinese women, one of whom died, are expected to make their second appearance in the Bellville Magistrate’s Court today. Zukile Tiko (34), Sixolile Duku (26) and Yonga Chitilali (32) first appeared last Monday for the alleged kidnapping in September of the victims, understood to have owned a business in Delft. National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) spokesperson Eric Ntabazalila said: “Three men appeared at the Bellville Magistrate’s Court on October 5. “They were arrested in the shack in Gugulethu where a kidnap victim was found dead.” Ntabazalila said their bail hearings of the three would continue today. Police spokesperson Andrè Traut said that the circumstances leading to the death of the 51-year-old Chinese woman were being investigated. Her body was discovered on October 2 at around 6.30am at a residence in Gugulethu. “It is believed that the victim made an attempt to escape from the Gugulethu residence after she and another Chinese woman, aged 34, were kidnapped by suspects on September 25 in Delft. “The exact cause of her death and the motive for the kidnapping are yet to be determined.” It is believed the men are from Mfuleni. Delft Community Policing Forum spokesperson Charles George said the fact that the women were hijacked in the area was of concern. “We believe that they have a business in Delft and are shocked that it happened under our noses,” George said.
