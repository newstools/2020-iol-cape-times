Cape Town – Tip-offs over dog fighting in Eerste River have led to the rescue of four dogs in two separate incidents. Cape of Good Hope (CoGH) SPCA spokesperson Belinda Abraham said inspectors removed two dogs from a home in the area on Tuesday after receiving information. “The dogs were found restrained with chains and both have the undeniable scarring pattern that results from dog fighting. “The SPCA is still investigating this incident but both dogs are now safely in our care. Charges in respect of contraventions of the Animals Protection Act No.71 of 1962 will be brought against the perpetrators,” said Abraham. The SPCA has offered a reward of R15 000 for information that results in the successful prosecution of suspects who were involved in making dogs fight in the area on Monday. According to Abraham, law enforcement officers were patrolling the area when they were flagged down by a pedestrian who reported suspected dog fighting under way. “The officers responded to the scene but the suspects fled. The SPCA and cadet inspector Mark Syce were notified and also responded. One dog has injuries to his face and forelegs and was visibly traumatised. Both dogs are now safe in the care of the SPCA. Their wounds have been treated and they have been seen by a veterinarian. “Our inspectors are on the heels of the perpetrators and charges of animal cruelty will be laid in terms of the Animals Protection Act,” she said. CoGH SPCA is appealing to the public to help identify both the suspects and any other individuals involved. To report animal cruelty, call the CoGH SPCA inspectorate on 021 700 4158/59 or 083 326 1604 for all after hours emergencies. Cape Times
