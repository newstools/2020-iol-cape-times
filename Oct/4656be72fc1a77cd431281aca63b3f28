Cape Town – They may only be the size of a lentil, but their synthetic legacy could last forever. From an environmental perspective, it is worse than an oil spill because nurdles won't break down, experts say. According to the Shark Spotters Coastal Rehabilitation team, a large number of nurdles have washed up on South Peninsula beaches over the last week – with Muizenberg, Fish Hoek, Simon’s Town, Millers Point, Witsand and Kommetjie affected so far. Shark Spotters has urged Capetonians to visit their local beach and collect as many nurdles as they can. They can be dropped off at any of the Shark Spotters stations. '’We need YOUR help to clean up the nurdles and quantify how bad this pollution event is! Please go down to your local beach and collect as many nurdles as you can find,“ Shark Spotters said in a statement. ’’Once collected, please drop them at any of the Shark Spotters stations (Muizenberg, Fish Hoek, etc), where they will weigh them, and together with The Beach Co-op, will ensure that we get an accurate record of the extent of the pollution and that they are properly disposed of. ’’Please leave a note in your bag of nurdles saying the location they were collected from and on what date!'' Nurdles are tiny beads of virgin plastic that are melted down and injection moulded to make a variety of new plastic products. Your plastic bag from the supermarket is made from nurdles, as well as dolls with the clip-on earrings and shoes. They threaten the marine environment as they easily make their way into the food chain when fish and other filter-feeding marine creatures mistake them for eggs and miniature jellyfish. Unfortunately, there are occasional incidents at sea where containers are lost overboard and the nurdles are released, causing a major environmental disaster. Cape Times
