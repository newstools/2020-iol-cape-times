Cape Town - Philippi residents planted trees in the areas where the bodies of two young women were recently found. The trees were planted on Saturday in memory of Amahle Quku, 17, whose bruised body was found by residents in Albert Luthuli Street in Browns Farm on June 20, and Nomvuzo Atoli, 22, who was found at the Siyanyanzela informal settlement in Philippi. Nomvuzo’s aunt Ntombizandile said four trees were planted. “It was an emotional day. Being back where our child was found brought back sad memories, but at the same time it was nice to see the amount of support that we had received from the community,” she said. The event was organised by the Community Policing Forum, Gender Based Violence Forum and local religious leaders. They also aimed to teach men and boys that they had the responsibility to protect women and children. Religious leader Anita Pamla said: “Those spots are crime scenes, but the planting of those trees was to show that Phillippi can be a dignified community. We wanted the trees to be symbols of new beginnings, and wipe away sadness and hurt that people feel when they look at those places,” she said. The deaths sparked an outcry as community members protested, stating that they didn’t feel safe any more. Amahle’s accused killer Leonard Mzingeli, 25, had abandoned bail at the Wynberg Magistrate’s Court on July 7. National Prosecuting Authority spokesperson Eric Ntabazalila said the matter was postponed to tomorrow for further investigation. Atoli’s accused killer was arrested at a hideout in Idutywa, Eastern Cape, on August 29. During his bail appearance in September, the prosecution said 29-yearold Sive Mpafa confessed that he repeatedly hit Atoli in the head with a brick. Mpafa was understood to have been recently released from jail on another charge of murder, which was provisionally withdrawn due to the death of a witness. The matter was postponed to November 3.
