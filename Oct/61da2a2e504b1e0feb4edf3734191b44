He added that his wife, who had to be hospitalised, is back home. "I remain in quarantine at home, I am resting and recuperating with only a cough remaining from my previous symptoms. Iâ€™m also very pleased that my wife has been discharged from hospital today and will now be joining me for quarantine at home," he said. IOL
