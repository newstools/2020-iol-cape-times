Cape Town – The bail application of the man accused of killing five people in Joe Slovo near Milnerton has been postponed to next week. Thulani Mbija, 26, who is among six suspects accused of the horrific murders, was arrested on Saturday following a search by police. He appeared briefly in court yesterday and National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) spokesperson Eric Ntabazalila said the State will oppose the bail application. “The NPA confirms that Thulani Mbija appeared at the Cape Town Magistrate’s Court. “He is charged with five counts of murder. His case has been postponed to October 26 for bail information and then for a bail application on November 4. The State will oppose the bail application,” said Ntabazalila. Ward councillor Mlulami Ngeyi said: “It is very sad to hear about these kinds of incidents. The perpetrators do not deserve bail at all. The community is still in shock and in mourning after this horrible incident. ’’The justice system must play a vital role in this because many people have died in the past month, all because of shooting.” Ngeyi said they expected shootings to increase as the festive season approached. Separately, the case of murder accused Mlondolozi Ntlangulela, the 34-year-old ex-boyfriend accused of killing Naledi Phangindawo from Mossel Bay, has been transferred to the Mossel Bay Regional Court. According to Southern Cape police, Ntlangulela had handed himself over to police. Preliminary reports showed Phangindawo was attacked with a sharp object which witnesses described as an axe.
