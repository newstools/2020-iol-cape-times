Cape Town – The case against Zane Killian, accused of the murder of top cop Colonel Charl Kinnear, has been transferred from Bishop Lavis Magistrate’s Court to Bellville Regional Court because of safety concerns. The former rugby player, 39, briefly appeared at Bishop Lavis Magistrate’s Court yesterday where a three-day appearance was set aside for a bail hearing. Killian faces charges of murder, unlawful interception of communication and conspiracy to commit murder after Kinnear was shot dead outside his home last month. National Prosecuting Authority spokesperson Eric Ntabazalila confirmed the case had been transferred. “The dates have been set, secured and agreed upon by all parties … where the bail application will start. We are looking forward to the start of the bail application. “The court was secured. The parties had a brief meeting with the regional court magistrate to secure these dates. Everything is ready. “The State communicated officially that we will oppose bail applications. We wouldn’t be charging him if we did not have evidence linking him to the case. “We are taking the matter to court because we feel he has a case to answer,” said Ntabazalila. Killian’s lawyer, Eric Beyer, said his client was taking “major strain” and was concerned about his autistic child. “It’s just alarming that no further arrests have been made. “The State is keeping everything close to the chest. We’re hoping they will co-operate, advise us and put us in a better position when the bail application is made. “He is blessed with an autistic special needs kid. The kid also suffers from cerebral palsy. “The kid is really being prejudiced… and taking major strain, and his behavioural patterns just escalated in the wrong direction. “That is his biggest concern, that he is not able to be with his kids. He does not really worry about himself but the fact that his special needs kid is being deprived of him,” said Beyer. Cape Times
