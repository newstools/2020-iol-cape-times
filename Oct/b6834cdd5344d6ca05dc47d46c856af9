Cape Town – Moorreesburg residents have reacted with disappointment as two police officers are only facing assault charges for the death of Manfred Lewies, 34, who died in police custody. Duwayne Williams and Justin Sassman are out on bail of R3 000 each, with conditions that include they may not visit Moorreesburg, not interfere with the investigation and not make contact with witnesses. Moorreesburg Community Action Group (MAG) spokesperson Samantha May said residents were disappointed that the pair “only face assault with intent to cause grievous bodily harm”. MAG member Boeta Booysen said Lewies’s mother, Katriena Fredericks, was still traumatised. “We are in the process of arranging counselling through the help of the family advocate Venice Burgins. All his mother wants to see is that justice prevails for her son who died in such a brutal manner,” said Booysen. Yesterday, the matter was postponed to December 7 for further investigation. Previously, the Independent Police Investigative Directorate confirmed it was investigating a case of police brutality. Lewies was arrested in September. He died after he was allegedly assaulted by police. Cape Times
