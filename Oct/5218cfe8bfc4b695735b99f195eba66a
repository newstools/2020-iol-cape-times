Cape Town – There is still no end in sight to the National Student Financial Aid Scheme (NSFAS) National Education and Health Allied Workers’ Union (Nehawu) workers strike. More than 50 NSFAS employees in Wynberg have been on an indefinite strike since last Monday for an 8% salary increase and improved working conditions. Negotiations began in June and continued for about a month before parties deadlocked on September 10 at the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration (CCMA) when the union rejected a proposed 4.3% counter-offer. Union bosses and the NSFAS administrator Dr Randall Carolissen met on Monday. “The matter is still being discussed and consultations are continuing. No agreement has been reached as yet,” said Carolissen. Nehawu provincial secretary Eric Kweleta said NSFAS had offered no increase. “I wouldn’t say there were discussions because the employer stated they stand by a zero offer a few minutes after the talks began. So they had no intention to really have a discussion with us. ’’Our members remain very resolute. The strike will continue until all our demands are met. ’’The employer has not shown interest to agree on anything from the list of demands at this stage. There were no engagements with the minister, as expected. He is not part of the bargaining,” Kweleta said. Nehawu on Friday submitted a presentation to a parliamentary portfolio committee on multiple allegations of corruption, maladministration, victimisation of workers, lack of IT systems and the alleged contract extension of Carolissen. “The minister extended the term of the administration for four months from September to December 2020. This was done silently, without the Government Gazette or consultation with stakeholders. ’’The minister did not consult key stakeholders before the extension. Nehawu and Sasco (SA Students Congress)were not consulted,” Kweleta alleged. Carolissen disputed the allegations and said a process to establish the facts was under way. Cape Times
