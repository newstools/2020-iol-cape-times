Cape Town – A repeat call has been made to have the so-called “rogue police intel” disbanded. The call was made by crime-fighting activist Colin Arendse, in a complaint lodged with crime intelligence head Peter Jacobs, calling for a thorough investigation. “I am aware from various media reports... that you submitted a report to the National Police Commissioner’s office in January 2019 that the rogue crime intel unit must be immediately disbanded and the legality of their operations be departmentally and criminally investigated,” an extract from Arendse’s complaint reads. “I place it on record that this criminal rogue unit has never been disbanded and continues to operate illegally causing havoc and mayhem in Cape Town. ’’Three individuals have since approached me to report that, like me, they are also victims of the criminal activities of this illegal rogue unit,” he went on. In the same complaint, Arendse brought to light a complaint by a Kuils River cop against a high-ranking official allegedly attached to the same “rogue crime intel unit” slain cop Charl Kinnear had also formally lodged a complaint against in 2019. This related to six officers who are alleged to be linked to high-flying gangsters. Enquiries to Jacobs were referred to national police spokesperson Vish Naidoo, who said yesterday SAPS has not uncovered such a unit . Naidoo said regarding allegations and counter-allegations being levelled against members in the Western Cape, the National Commissioner has deployed a team of senior officers to investigate. “A number of dockets pertaining to these allegations and counter-allegations were removed and are being dealt with at head office level. ’’Seeing that this matter is still pending and with the sub-judice rule being in play with some of the cases, I am going to choose not to comment further. It will suffice to say that these matters are receiving attention.” Cape Times
