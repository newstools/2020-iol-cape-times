CAPE TOWN - The City of Cape Town has noticed an increase in the number of drivers blatantly endangering other road users, as well as street racers driving recklessly while drunk. Authorities say they arrested 24 people during illegal street racing operations in the city, and of these eight were found to be under the influence of alcohol. “There is a definite increase in the number of drivers who are willing to take risks with their own lives with a blatant disregard for the safety of other road users,” said Mayoral Committee Member Alderman JP Smith. “In addition, we have illegal street racers who run the gauntlet while inebriated and this is not only reckless, but foolish”. Illegal street racing operations were held in the Sea Point, Century City and Bellville areas, and during one operation alone, six people were arrested for driving drunk. “These events attract spectators who can become the innocent victims and it is unacceptable that drivers get behind the wheel while impaired,” Alderman Smith added. In other operations, officers issued over 59 000 fines and impounded 127 vehicles. Authorities also arrested a driver in Lwandle for bribery and obstruction after he offered officers R100 to get out of a traffic fine. “When you break the law, you have to be prepared to do the time when you get caught. Bribing officers is illegal and will only add to the charges against you. I commend the officers for not being swayed by such offers,” Alderman Smith said. IOL Motoring
