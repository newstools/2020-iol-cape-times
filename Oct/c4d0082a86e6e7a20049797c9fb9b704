Cape Town – The man accused of raping a 20-year-old woman at a quarantine site in Mossel Bay has been denied bail. Clinton Hartnick made his third appearance in the Mossel Bay Magistrate’s Court yesterday. Hartnick, who works for cleaning company Procon Facilities Management, was arrested on September 11 at the Westcamp Petrosa Quarantine and Isolation Site near Mossel Bay. The incident was reported to medical personnel at the facility, who alerted police. The patient was removed from the site by the Department of Health to a different location. National Prosecuting Authority spokesperson Eric Ntabazalila said Hartnick was denied bail. “Clinton Hartnick, charged with rape of a patient at a quarantine site in Mossel Bay, appeared at the Mossel Bay Magistrate’s Court for bail application judgment. He was denied bail and his case has been postponed to November 25,” said Ntabazalila. Advocacy group Ilitha Labantu said it had attended nine cases of rape and sexual abuse of women and children in Wynberg Magistrate’s Court last week. Organisation spokesperson Siyabulela Monakali welcomed the court’s decision in denying Hartnick bail. “Previously we have seen where people were granted bail by the court and they go out and commit the same crime. This shows the seriousness of the court on rape and sexual abuse cases,” Monakali said. Cape Times
