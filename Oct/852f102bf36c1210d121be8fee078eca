Cape Town – A cyclist has been reunited with her bicycle after she was robbed of it at gunpoint by four suspects in Hood Road, Belgravia, on Saturday. A 27-year-old suspect was arrested after he attempted to sell the bicycle at a second-hand retailer in Parow on Wednesday. Mahdi Kariem, 58, said: “My wife and I are so happy to be reunited with the bike. It is just tragic that our friend is in and out of hospital due to the fractured bones in his face and he is always in so much pain.” Kariem and his wife had at the weekend been cycling with a friend when they noticed “joggers” ahead of them. Upon reaching them, two men surfaced from the bush and started throwing bricks at the cyclists, breaking the friend’s nose and cheekbone. ’’Kariem said the suspects had ran into the nearby informal settlement and later demanded R1 500 for the bicycle. “We will be cycling again but not from our house. We will have to drive to a safer area now,” said Kariem. Police spokesperson FC Van Wyk said: “The suspect was arrested on September 27 and appeared in the Athlone Magistrate’s Court on Monday.” The Pedal Power Association warned cyclists to ride in large numbers and to be aware of their surroundings at all times.
