Cape Town – The SA Transport and Allied Workers Union (Satawu), which represents Golden Arrow Bus Service drivers, has called for the installation of surveillance cameras after yet another brazen attack. About 30 commuters and a bus driver were robbed at 4.20pm on Monday by three armed men. The robbers, who allegedly posed as passengers, boarded a Golden Arrow bus from Cape Town and robbed people at gunpoint in Jakes Gerwel Drive at Samora Machel. They cellphones and money. Golden Arrow spokesperson Bronwen Dyke-Beyer said the incident was immediately reported at Lentegeur police station. She could not say how many armed robberies had taken place on buses since lockdown. “We are extremely concerned … The overall number of robberies is extremely low when one considers that we run more than 5 000 trips per day. We do, however, believe that one incident is too many. “Golden Arrow is contracted to the government to offer a public service   we cannot replace the role that the SAPS must play in terms of public safety. We continue to lobby government at all levels as we believe that arrests and convictions are the only way to curb crime,” she said. Police spokesperson FC van Wyk said a case of a robbery with a firearm was registered for investigation. “The case will be transferred to the Samora Michel police station for further investigation,” he said. No arrests had been made. Satawu’s Solomon Mahlangu said the union was concerned about passengers and drivers who were traumatised. “The company should have a register of such incidents and streamline efficient communication with stakeholders, especially trade unions, whenever such incidents occur.” Golden Arrow is offering a R50 000 reward for information which leads to the arrest and conviction of perpetrators of bus robberies. Anyone with information can phone Crime Stop on 08600 10111, or SMS Crime Line on 32211. Callers may remain anonymous. Cape Times
