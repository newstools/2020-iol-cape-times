Cape Town – Family, friends and colleagues of Superintendent Charlene Moses, who died as a result of Covid-19, planted a tree and unveiled a plaque at the Green Point horse stables in her honour on Tuesday. Moses, manager of the City’s metro police department’s equestrian unit, died at the age of 40 in June. Mayoral committee member for safety and security JP Smith said the department decided to commemorate Moses in a substantial way. “The metro police decided that it was not good enough just to have a memorial service for Charlene Moses when she passed away. They decided to commemorate her on a more permanent basis and therefore they have put out a bench with her name on it and the tree. “I think it is a really beautiful gesture, it is a way for us to remember these officers who have long passed, the daily grind of life that has caused you to forget. “We will have a memorial service for all the staff once the lockdown permits it but in the meantime, this is a very special gesture from the management and metro police,” said Smith. He described Moses as a “no-nonsense” woman who could be tough when the job called for it. “In a gang unit she is very much being missed. She has left a gap behind and I think she has touched a lot more lives than many people may have in their daily working lives.” Moses’s older sister Sonja Arendse said her sister would be sorely missed because she was a pillar of strength in the family. “Sometimes I would just pick up a phone and call her to just say can we talk and now that is missing. She will always be in our hearts, she was our everything, she was the strongest person in our family. Even though I am the oldest, I was never the oldest because she was our (backbone) and we will miss her a lot. “It is still unreal that she is no more,” said Arendse. Cape Times
