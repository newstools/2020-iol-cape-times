Cape Town – Mayor Dan Plato has been accused of being a “consistent culprit” in blurring the lines between state and political affairs after he attended DA interim leader John Steenhuisen’s rally before the party’s elective conference, apparently in his official capacity as mayor. A photograph of Plato is doing the rounds on social media amid allegations that he attended the rally at the weekend in his capacity as executive mayor. Good party secretary-general Brett Herron accused the DA of previously failing to separate party and state affairs, and said Plato was a “particularly consistent culprit”. Herron said there was no logical reason for the executive mayor of any city to speak in a mayoral capacity at any party political event, especially an internal party election rally. “Internal DA elections are manipulated and the party’s inner cabal is behind both the Steenhuisen and Plato leadership campaigns. ’’My guess is they used the mayoral capacity to cover up the reciprocal support between the campaigns, and in doing so Plato stupidly claimed he was there in his capacity as mayor.” ANC caucus leader Xolani Sotashe said the DA had blamed the ANC for doing “exactly what they are doing”. “Their politics of deception have been exposed. We hope no taxpayers’ money will be used for the party rally as is the case where Dan Plato is seen distributing food parcels to people wearing DA T-shirts. ’’He has been accused by his own party of using food parcels to buy votes for the upcoming metro conference of the party.” City Speaker Dirk Smit said he did not have enough information to confirm the particulars of Plato having attended the rally in order to comment. Plato’s spokesperson, Greg Wagner, said Plato was a member of the DA and had endorsed DA leaders previously. “Dan Plato is a DA mayor, and did the same as several other DA public representatives.” Steenhuisen did not respond to questions.
