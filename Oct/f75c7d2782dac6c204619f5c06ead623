Cape Town - More than 40 long-haul trucks and heavy-duty rescue vehicles, escorted by dozens of motorcycles, have rolled into Killarney International Raceway. The trucks arrived on Sunday, loaded with soft toys to be donated to the Cancer Association of South Africa’s campaign for toys for children with cancer. The giants of the road were drawn up in two impressive columns on the back straight for temperature screening, hand sanitising and the completion of a health and safety questionnaire by their crews, before parking on the oval behind the Killarney Clubhouse. Killarney’s first major charity event since lockdown became a celebration of family as parents chatted and relaxed in the shade while their children enjoyed the spring sunshine and the dedicated Kiddies Korner play area. Level 1 health and safety protocols were enforced, as was physical distancing and mask-wearing, but no mask could hide the smiles of the truckers and their children, and the Cansa volunteers, as they filled a one-ton bakkie to overflowing with soft toys. The toys will go to brighten hospital wards and surgeries countrywide. Cape Argus Do you have something on your mind; or want to comment on the big stories of the day? We would love to hear from you.
