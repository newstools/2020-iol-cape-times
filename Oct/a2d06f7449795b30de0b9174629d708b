Cape Town – By-elections are on the cards for the Greater Oudtshoorn Municipality after three DA ward councillors tendered their resignations from the party, saying they were “tired of racism within its structures”. Nellie Soman of ward 10, Ewa Fortuin of ward 4, and Hendrik Ruiters of ward 5 resigned on the same day. Ruiters said the actions of the DA leadership over the past four years made it “very clear that they were not prepared to act in the interest of the people”, and that many were twofaced. “One (face) is held up for the media and the other is the reality of what happens behind the scenes: that of white leadership and the promotion of white-owned businesses,” he said. Ruiters said his resignation from ward 5 was in the interest of the broader community. “I followed all DA’s internal processes to report and expose financial irregularities in the Oudtshoorn Municipality since the DA portrayed to the media that they were a party that fights against corruption. “I also followed all Oudtshoorn Municipality processes to expose financial irregularities since the Municipal Finance Management Act (MFMA) and our broader community expected of me to fight corruption,” he said. DA Oudtshoorn constituency head Eleanor Bouw-Spies said the resignation of the three councillors came as they were facing disciplinary action for contravening council and party rules and regulations. “The three councillors were facing disciplinary steps for missing consecutive council meetings over the last few months. ’’The councillors had also started to abstain from voting in council meetings, contrary to the DA caucus decision,” she said. Bouw-Spies said by-elections for new ward councillors would take place. The councillors’ resignations follow that of former executive mayor Colan Sylvester, who did not reinstate his membership after it was terminated by the DA in June. Colan alleged the DA in Oudtshoorn and the region was ‘biased’ in their actions. Cape Times
