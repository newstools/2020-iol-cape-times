Cape Town – The family of Deon Kampher, 66, say it has been an agonising two months and 17 days since their father went missing in Wittedrift, Plettenberg Bay. On August 7, Kampher’s son Fanus Leo took his father, who struggles with speech and memory loss, to see family in Wittedrift as his home underwent renovations. Kampher disappeared the next day, after apparently going for a walk. “At the moment we are not okay. We are praying every night for him to come back as soon as possible,” Leo said. Once informed his father was missing, Leo went to the police, and a family, community and police search ensued. A few days later, the family was informed that Kampher was apparently seen at night walking along a dirt road. “We started searching there. A drone was used, a security company phoned their clients in the area for access to their premises for the search. “The community was supportive and we are appreciative for that,” Leo said. Police spokesperson Christopher Spies said an investigation indicated that Kampher had visited family at Lemon Street, Wittedrift near Plettenberg Bay on August 8 when he disappeared. “It is alleged that he was sitting outside the residence with his sister. She went into the house and on her return noticed that he was gone. “A search party was established at the time of his disappearance but efforts to trace him were unsuccessful. The search for (Kampher) is ongoing,” Spies said Anyone with information can contact investigating officer Sergeant Columbus Mtshazi at 044 501 1908 or anonymously contact Crime Stop at 08600 10111, or SMS Crime Line 32211.
