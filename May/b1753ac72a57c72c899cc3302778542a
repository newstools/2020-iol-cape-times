Emergency Medical Services spokesperson Deanna Bessick said: “The Provincial Health Emergency Medical Services responded to a call at 12.18pm on Thursday, May 14. "An infant was found in a bag by a community member near Mfuleni. The baby was taken to Eerste River Hospital. The baby was still breathing,” she said. Siyabulela Monakali, spokesperson at Ilitha Labantu, a social service and educational organisation with a focus on addressing violence against women and children, has urged people to take children to safe spaces. “It always saddens us to hear of incidents where unwanted babies are dumped. This is inhumane and should be put to an end. As a society we can do so much better. "There are places of care that welcome unwanted babies and children. These places can provide the necessary care for these babies. "As a society we need to do better to protect our children,” Monakali said.
