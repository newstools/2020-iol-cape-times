Cape Town – The University of the Western Cape has recorded its first Covid-19-related death. Mogamat Amien Salie, who joined the university in 1997, was working off-campus when he contracted the coronavirus. "Mr Salie succumbed to Covid-19 in the early morning of Saturday, 16 May, 2020," said Gasant Abarder, UWC Manager: Media, Marketing and Communications. "He was working remotely from home when he contracted the virus. The majority of UWC staff and students at the university are not allowed on campus unless they are essential workers. "The only essential services workers on campus at the moment are those in our Risk and Compliance Directorate, who are tasked with protecting university property from theft and vandalism." “Amien was buried in line with Muslim rites. He was a dear friend, colleague and mentor to many within his team," a UWC statement said of the dedicated member of the Student Laboratory Support team, who served as a technician. "Amien will always be remembered for his willingness to stand up for those who were not always able to fight for themselves. "Despite challenging circumstances at times, he would go the extra mile and assist those who were less fortunate, even if that meant putting himself in a difficult situation. "After 23 long years of service, he will be sorely missed. We would like to express our sincerest condolences to his family and friends during these trying times." Cape Times
