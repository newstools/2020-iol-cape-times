Cape Town – The City of Cape Town’s Coastal Management Department continues to monitor the thriving coastal wildlife during the lockdown. Among the wildlife spotted off Simon’s Town was a charming and beautiful southern elephant seal, which was seen early yesterday morning at the harbour; two orcas; a Cape clawless otter; a large caracal; southern right; humpbacked and Brydes whale; as well as the bottle-nosed, common, humpbacked and dusky dolphin. "The seal was first sighted yesterday, so it appears it has been resting in this location and has likely come ashore to moult, which could take up to a month," the City said on Wednesday. "It is not certain whether this was a juvenile male or female as adult male southern elephant seals develop a ‘trunk’ at roughly four years' maturity. What is certain though, is that this seal felt free to just be and didn’t mind getting its picture taken while doing so. "The City’s Coastal Management team has also recently followed and photographed the two famous orcas known as Port and Starboard in Simon’s Town’s waters. "Furthermore, they have recorded a number of sightings of Cape clawless otter during the lockdown period, as well as large caracal which has been frequenting this coastal suburb. "A number of other mammals are found in Simon’s Town bay, the most common being the southern right; humpbacked and Brydes whale, as well as the bottle-nosed, common, humpbacked and dusky dolphin.
