The flooding in Cape Town comes as snowfall hit the Klein Karoo, forcing the closure of major roads and a mountain pass. Cape Town disaster management spokesperson Charlotte Powell said the City’s informal settlements department would assess and provide flood kits to the affected Langa residents. “No emergency sheltering was activated,” Powell said. She said there were no other major incidents. The snowfall on the Swartberg Mountains, north of Oudtshoorn, forced the closure of the Swartberg Pass between Oudtshoorn and Prince Albert yesterday, provincial traffic chief Kenny Africa said. This traditionally means trips up the mountains for adventurers, but this time residents may only experience it from their chilly sitting rooms, as municipal spokesperson Ntobeko Mangqwengqwe said in terms of lockdown regulations, visiting snow was not permitted. “In terms of the alert level 4 regulations issued by Minister Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma on April 29, visiting of snow is not listed as essential service, It has also not been catered for in Chapter 3 of these regulations on movement of persons,” he said. The SA Weather Service said yesterday localised flooding was expected to continue in Cape Town, and very cold conditions were expected over the Northern Cape. Cape Times
