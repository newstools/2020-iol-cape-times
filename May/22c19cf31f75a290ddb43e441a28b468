Zuzo was welcomed by a cheering crowd of hospital staff who sang the national anthem as he made his way to the ground floor and out of the building. He was admitted to the Melomed Gatesville Hospital on April 26, where he spent three weeks unconscious and undergoing treatment to fight the coronavirus.
