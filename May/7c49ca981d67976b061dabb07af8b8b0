The organisations will focus on food security relief programmes, sanitiser distribution to help protect people when moving about post-lockdown and prevention. Hand-washing stations will be deployed and funds will be provided to place health workers in selected public clinics. “Enabling communities with the right tools and education will empower them to stay safe at this particularly challenging time. Responsible engagement with our stakeholders, including communities and regulators, is a cornerstone of AECI’s values. “We are stronger together when we work together for a common purpose,” AECI’s chief executive, Mark Dytor said. AECI’s Covid-19 response campaign is in its second month and has already helped improve the circumstances of over 500 000 South Africans by donating water treatment resources, bars of soap, sanitisers and masks for household use. The group has sponsored a mass behavioural change and educational hand-washing programme to the value of R7.9 million. Supporting government clinics and hospitals, AECI donated uniquely designed and locally manufactured hand-washing stations. These stations contain education and sanitisation information for patients prior to site entry. Sponsored health workers assist in maintaining social distancing and ensuring every patient wash their hands before entering the clinic and learns more about the correct methods to prevent the spread of the virus.
