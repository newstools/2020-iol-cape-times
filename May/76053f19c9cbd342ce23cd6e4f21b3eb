Cape Town – The Saftu-affiliated National Union of Public and Allied Workers protested outside Tygerberg Hospital yesterday, demanding improved protection for health-care workers. It is understood kitchen staff refused to work on Monday, demanding to be tested for Covid-19. After the protest, Saftu secretary Andre Adams said they were calling for the Department of Labour to conduct a thorough inspection of the facility. Hospital spokesperson Laticia Pienaar said 139 employees had tested positive for Covid-19 as of May 22. “The hospital will continue to implement measures to maximise protection of staff, while also asking staff to ensure their own safe behaviour at the workplace and at home. “The hospital wishes to work with organised labour unions to jointly ensure that staff are optimally protected in their workplaces.” The Western Cape continues to be the country’s Covid-19 epicentre with 15 756 confirmed cases, 357 deaths and 7 844 recoveries. Premier Alan Winde said: “In (Minister Mkhize’s) presentation, he indicated that some hot spots could remain on alert level 4 when the rest of the country moved to alert level 3 on June 1, with the hot spots being re-evaluated every two weeks. “I will seek clarity from the president on this matter. In any province, it would be very difficult to enforce some areas remaining on level 4, while others drop down to level 3.” Cape Times
