Cape Town - A third police station has had to close in the Eastern Cape after a police officer tested positive for the coronavirus. This comes as five police stations had to close in the Western Cape at the weekend – Sea Point, Mowbray, Woodstock, Manenberg and Stellenbosch – due to Covid-19-related cases. In the Eastern Cape, the King William's Town police station was forced to close at the weekend, with officers operating from a hall on the premises. The Buffalo City municipality – which comprises the towns of East London, Bhisho and King William's Town – is also making a community centre available to the police. The Zwide and Motherwell police station had to be closed temporarily recently due to officers testing positive for the coronavirus. Eastern Cape police commissioner Khela Sitole has offered his condolences to the two police officers who have lost their lives to Covid-19 – a captain in the Eastern Cape and a warrant officer in KwaZulu-Natal. Of the 370 police offficers that have tested positive, 370 reside in the Western Cape. Cape Times
