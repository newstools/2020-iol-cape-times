The depot will be closed for the next three days while the facility and vehicles are deep-cleaned and disinfected. The City said those who were in contact with the affected staff member were placed in self-quarantine to monitor their symptoms. Two weeks ago a sit-in was held at the Woodstock collections depot following disputes over the supply of personal protective equipment (PPE) to refuse workers which resulted in garbage removal delays. Residents complained of piling rubbish being a health hazard. City spokesperson Priya Reddy said the City engaged with staff and provided them with appropriate gloves, which were in short supply, and two cloth masks each as per the requirement, with directions for washing and re-use. “Re-use of cloth masks is endorsed by guidelines issued by the National Department of Health. Hand sanitisers are available to all staff. "We issue one sanitiser to each staff member, inclusive of the drivers. Currently, the sanitiser is supplied in bulk to the facility. “Due to challenges with the availability of small dispensers like spray bottles, staff members were requested to keep the smaller dispensers and refill them as and when required,” Reddy said. Residents and businesses in the affected areas, including Sea Point, Dunoon and Langa, have been urged to keep their bins on their properties until the next scheduled removal day or next week.
