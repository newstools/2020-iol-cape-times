The consulate-general also donated food supplies worth nearly R20 000 to vulnerable Redhill residents in Simon’s Town. A week ago the Chinese consulate donated food packs worth R8 000 to constituency heads. Consul-general Lin Jing said the pandemic has presented many challenges. “I hope this donation will alleviate the shortage of anti-pandemic materials and help the poor and vulnerable,” Jing said. National Assembly Deputy Speaker Lechesa Tsenoli said the donation helped to fill a need in the country. “The supply of surgical masks has been a problem in our country, in the sense that certain hospitals do not have enough,” he said. A representative from Today SA thanked the consulate for the donation. “This donation means a lot to people who have been struggling to put food on the table for the past weeks and months. “We really have a great need for this. The current pandemic has made things a lot harder,” they said. Cape Times
