Cape Town â€“ The latest average dam level for the Western Cape is 35.7 percent, which is only 2 percent higher than at the same time last year, but there are hopes for significant rainfall next week. The dams providing water to the City of Cape Town are a combined 53.6 percent, down from the previous week's 54.3 percent. This is 9 percent better than at the same time last year. The Steenbras Upper dam is 96.5 percent full and the Wemmershoek dam only 43.4 percent. Cape Town's main supply dam, Theewaterskloof, is 50.2 percent full. Local Government, Environmental Affairs and Development Planning Anton Bredell said the department is being briefed by the South African Weather Service on a weekly basis to keep an eye on weather predictions. According to Bredell, the medium- to long-term outlook remains largely unpredictable. While no rain is expected this week, a major cold front is expected next week, which may lead to some significant rainfall over large parts of the province.
