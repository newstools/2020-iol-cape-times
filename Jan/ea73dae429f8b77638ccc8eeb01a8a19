Cape Town â€“ A "well respected" and experienced Mountain Club of South Africa (MCSA) mountaineer died in a climbing accident at Muizenberg Crag on Sunday afternoon. A total of 25 members from the MCSA rescue team assisted in a large Western Cape Search and Rescue effort involving multiple organisations at Muizenberg Crag, the MCSA said in statement on Monday. A technical rescue climber and a paramedic were also transported by the Western Cape Government Department of Health AMS Rescue helicopter to reach the climber. "Challenging weather conditions dictated a combined air and ground approach. A ground team hiked up the mountain to perform a rope based technical cliff extraction, where they moved the patient off the cliff face and to a more sheltered area, where the helicopter could fly the patient off the mountain," the MCSA said. "The MCSA extends its deepest condolences to his family and all who knew him." No further information was available.
