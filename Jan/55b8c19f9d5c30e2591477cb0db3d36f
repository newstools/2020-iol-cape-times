Cape Town – Three suspects were arrested at a garage in Panorama, Parow, early this morning on a charge of business robbery. At about 1.30am, gunfire was exchanged after police pursued three suspects between the ages of 30 and 35 after receiving information about a business robbery in progress, Western Cape police spokesperson Siyabulelo Malo said on Friday. The trio were subsequently arrested and detained, while two pistols and an undisclosed amount of cash were seized. The suspects are expected to make a court appearance in the Bellville Magistrate's Court on Monday on charges of business robbery and the possession of unlicensed firearms. Last night, members of the Flying Squad responded to a complaint of a person driving a vehicle recklessly on the N7 in Dunoon. "The members spotted the vehicle in Parklands and instructed the driver to pull over. A further search was conducted in the vehicle and resulted in the seizure of a 9mm Norinco Star pistol with ammunition," Malo said. Two suspects, both aged 23, were arrested and are expected to make a court appearance in the Cape Town Magistrate’s Court on Monday for possession of a prohibited firearm and ammunition. Cape Times
