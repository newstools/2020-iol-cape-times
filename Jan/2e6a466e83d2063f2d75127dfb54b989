The 53-year-old was arrested in Gauteng last week where he also made a brief court appearance. Attention was first drawn to Barnes on January 4 when he was reported missing by his family after he left his Edgemead home at 3.30am to attend the Stragglers Beachcomber race at the Strandfontein Pavilion, but did not arrive. The car he used was recovered the following day at Cape Town International Airport. While the search for the “missing” Barnes continued, WPA said “irregularities” had been uncovered. “As a board we have found irregularities since Mr Barnes’s disappearance and we are conducting a full investigation into the matter,” WPA resident Jakes Jacobs initially said.

The case was postponed to April 30. Cape Times
