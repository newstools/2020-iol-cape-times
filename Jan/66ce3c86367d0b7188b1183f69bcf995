The Cape of Good Hope (CoGH) SPCA’s wildlife department was happy to bid farewell to Josh last Friday as he set out on a new journey. Josh was confiscated in December after he was found living in conditions for which CoGH SPCA inspectors are pursuing prosecution. “The CoGH SPCA staff quickly grew attached to Josh and while we were all sad to see him leave us, we are thankful that he’ll be living out his life at a free-flight bird sanctuary with others of his kind. “Josh will need to learn to fly after being cruelly confined in a small cage, but once he is capable of flight, he’ll be introduced into the forest sanctuary, joining the rest of the macaws,” the organisation said. “We thank Birds of Eden for giving him a home where he is free to express his natural behaviours; Steenberg Veterinary Clinic for doing his check-up and beak/nail trimming free; Annerie de Waal for her donation of fresh produce, mixed nuts, wooden toys, parrot cereal and parrot plumage enhancer, and CemAir for sponsoring Josh’s flight to Plettenberg Bay as a VIP (Very Important Parrot) passenger. “Your generous support enabled us to give Josh a better life, free from confinement and stress. It’s amazing what can be achieved when special people unite for an animal in need.” Report animal cruelty by calling the SPCA on 021 700 4158/9 or emailing inspectorate@spca-ct.co.za.
