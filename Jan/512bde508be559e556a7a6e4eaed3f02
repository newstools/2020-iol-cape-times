“We’re very upset about this. The community has not been involved in the decision process. This is a community hall that provides services to the community and surrounds,” Wynberg East Civic Association acting chair- person Yunus Karriem said. “The youth need every avenue to keep them away from the ills of society.” The building is listed online for R5million and marketed as a commercial property by Safcom Properties. On Wednesday, residents tried to get answers from the owners but were prevented from attending the meeting. They are fearful that the centre will be sold to a developer. Community activist and resident Colin Arendse, who attended the meeting, said: “We tried to get to the bottom of this but they were so angry to see us. I believe someone is giving them the wrong information. The owners are adamant at this time that they will be selling the building so everyone’s hands are tied.” Last year, residents of Wynberg had their hands full trying to preserve old buildings sold to developers to construct mixed-use complexes. Karate teacher Abubakr Petersen, who offers classes for youths at the centre, said they would have to recruit a lawyer and prepare for a legal battle. “We are going to make a legal matter out of this. I believe that everything about this sale is very strange and I can only speculate about this centre because we are not sure what will happen to the centre,” he said. Youth centre acting chairperson Joan Reagon refused to comment. marvin.charles@inl.co.za Cape Argus
