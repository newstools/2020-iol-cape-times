It is believed that Chingono, a postgraduate LLB student, took her own life at her home in Pretoria. Messages of condolences for her family, friends and fellow students poured in on Wednesday. “You made so many people laugh and smile on our campus. You touched people’s lives every day. Rest in power,” a student said. Senior director of student affairs at SU, Dr Choice Makhetha, urged students to reach out for help. “The Stellenbosch University management and the university community wish to express our condolences and will provide all possible support to anyone affected by Chingono’s passing. Our thoughts and prayers are with her parents, family and friends. “The university has been in contact with her family, and there is ongoing liaison between the Centre for Student Counselling and Development and the residence head. "We want to remind our students that asking for help is never shameful. When struggling, talk to friends, family or someone who will listen,” said Makhetha. The institution is preparing to welcome around 5 500 first-year students today. The final enrolment number will be known after the registration process has been concluded. Cape Times
