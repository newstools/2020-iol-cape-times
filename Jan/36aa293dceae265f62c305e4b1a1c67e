Jean-Pierre Balous was arrested on December 29 after violence broke out outside the church between a group of refugees supporting him and refugees supporting his second-in-command, Papy Sukami. Following his arrest, Balous appeared in Court on January 3 on assault charges and is still in police custody. Subsequent to Balous’ arrest and court appearance, Sukami was arrested on January 3 and appeared in court on Monday. Police spokesperson Captain Frederick van Wyk said: “A 41-year-old man has been arrested on charges of robbery. “He was detained by the investigating officer and appeared in the Cape Town Magistrate’s Court on Monday.” The case was postponed to tomorrow for further investigation. Refugee Leon Mulumbi and others around him in front of the church yesterday lamented Balous’ absence and said they could not take any decisions or speak about the way forward. Bemoaning the absence of Sukami, refugee Patrick Ngandu said: “We are all refugees and we come here because of xenophobia. "Now we are waiting on accommodation, because it’s not nice the way we are living here in the street, with no toilets, no water and no food.” Cape Times
