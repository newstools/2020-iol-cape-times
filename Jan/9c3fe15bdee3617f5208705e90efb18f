The 27-year-old mother was reported missing by her cousin last Monday after he returned from the Eastern Cape to a locked house. He grew suspicious when other relatives and a neighbour didn’t know her whereabouts. Another of Mgolodela’s cousins, Brenda Kunene, said Mgolodela was last known to have gone to her boyfriend’s house, but the house was locked and his neighbours also didn’t know his whereabouts. She said another neighbour who arrived later in the day informed the family that the last time she saw Mgolodela was around 9pm. Last Tuesday the body of a woman was discovered behind a local fishery business by passers-by going to work. The body was burned beyond recognition Police spokesperson André Traut said: “Circumstances surrounding the disappearance of Vuyokazi Mgolodela are still under investigation and the identity of the body found in Makhaza is yet to be confirmed.” The family said although they were waiting for DNA results, they felt the body belonged to Mgolodela. Kunene said Mgolodela’s boyfriend was arrested on Sunday. However the Cape Times is still waiting for police confirmation of the arrest.
