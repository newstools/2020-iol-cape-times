The first hearing is at the Southern Sun Cape Sun at 23 Strand Street from 9am until 5pm. Energy expert Ted Blom said he had an overwhelming response to the proposed hike through his website. “Almost 200 000 people sent a comment to the regulator through our system. Such tremendous response is a true demonstration of the power of the public voice when fuelled by disapproval,” said Blom. He encouraged those who missed the deadline for written comments to still have their say via his website as he would be representing the public at the hearings in each province next month. Nersa has allocated a single day and venue for each province, with two for Gauteng. Eskom said they had continued to manage a volatile power system with a low risk of load shedding. “We begin the week with generation units breakdowns at 13392MW as at 7.30 this morning (Monday) the system is tighter than last week so we will use emergency generators to supplement capacity while work to return units out of service for maintenance continues. "We request customers to work with us by reducing their demand while we work on stabilising the power system.” Comments can be made via Blom’s website on www.eeco.co.za Cape Times
