Cape Town – Two men in their twenties who robbed a man of R500 in cash, his cellphone, car keys and a camera between the Sunrise and Sonwabi beaches were arrested shortly afterwards. This area, further away from the popular swimming beaches of Muizenberg, has sporadically been plagued by opportunistic muggings. The suspects had robbed their victims of cellphones and cash before disappearing over Baden Powell Drive into the dense bushes adjoining the Capricorn area, City of Cape Town Law Enforcement Inspector Wayne Dyason said on Wednesday. The 23- and 27-year-old male suspects had just robbed an unsuspecting male victim of  R500 in cash and a Samsung phone, car keys and a small camera. Having been alerted by the victim, the officers tracked them down to Capricorn. "When they saw the officers, they tried to flee, but the officers gave chase and quickly arrested both suspects in Capricorn at the taxi rank," Dyason said. "A knife and all the stolen items were found on the suspects." They were arrested and taken to the Muizenberg police station. Cape Times
