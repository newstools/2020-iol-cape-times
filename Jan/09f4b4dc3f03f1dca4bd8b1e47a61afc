Another tweeted: "He'll move to another app and people will join that app solely to see what he is posting there. That app will use that milage (sic) to bash Twitter for lack of freedom of speech and it'll become as big as Twitter. My point is -- Twitter has a lot to lose in doing so." A user tagged @Twitter and urged: "Don't let the 'president' use your platform for imperialism. DELETE his account. #NoWarWithlran #AnitImperialism." "Wow. Deep. @Twitter for your consideration...," wrote another user. "Please Twitter, please," pleaded a Twitter user.
