The City enforced its by-laws against public fireworks displays without a permit. “The City has not approved any sites, other than the V&A Waterfront, for the discharge of fireworks. Law enforcement was determined to stop the illegal discharge of fireworks because of its effects on animals. "Hundreds of fireworks were confiscated from areas such as Milnerton, Parkwood, Strand and Delft,” City law enforcement spokesperson Inspector Wayne Dyason said. Despite the ban on fireworks, the SPCA had a busy New Year’s Eve, including assisting with a cat that had become lodged between two walls, and a badly injured stray dog. Both situations were likely a result of the animals fleeing in terror following the discharge of fireworks. Cape of Good Hope SPCA spokesperson Belinda Abraham said they had not yet begun to see the devastation caused by the night’s festivities. The Cape of Good Hope SPCA appealed to residents to keep a lookout for any injured or stray animals and notify them at 0217004158/9 during office hours and at 083 326 1604 after-hours. Cape Times
