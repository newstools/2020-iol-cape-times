NSRI Mykonos duty crew launched their sea rescue craft Spirit of Rotary East London II at Port Owen on Saturday morning to meet up with the SA Amandla, who had alerted the SA Foundation for the Conservation of Coastal Birds (Sanccob) to what crew believed was a seabird injured on the ship. “A seabird that landed on the SA Amandla around December 27 while she was at sea was being cared for and fed by the SA Amandla crew. “But after the bird failed to fly away and appeared to be weak, Sanccob were alerted,” NSRI Mykonos station commander Mike Shaw said. “Sanccob contacted the NSRI requesting our intervention and on Saturday we rendezvoused with SA Amandla 12 nautical miles offshore of Laaiplek and the bird was transferred on to our sea rescue craft and brought to shore, where it was collected by Sanccob. “Believing the bird to be a petrel, NSRI crew named the bird Diesel, but Sanccob confirmed that the bird is a Cory’s shearwater, which are not often seen,” Shaw said. Sanccob is caring for the bird but tests and X-rays have not yet determined any medical issue at this stage. The tests and care for the bird are continuing. Sanccob have also confirmed that the Cory’s shearwater is fully migrant and is found in the sub-Antarctic region across to South America and up to Northern Europe. Cape Times
