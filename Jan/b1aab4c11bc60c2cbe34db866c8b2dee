Cape Town – A suspect has been arrested after two Law Enforcement officers on duty in the Govan Mbeki Drive transport corridor in Philippi were held up at gunpoint in Philippi. The officers were patrolling an area where bus commuters have been robbed recently at about 1.20pm on Monday when two suspects robbed one of the officer's of his cellphone and walked towards a nearby informal settlement, Law Enforcement Inspector Wayne Dyason said on Wednesday. "The officers flagged down a passing SAPS vehicle and the suspects fled into the nearby Kampies informal settlement with the officers hot on their heels," said Dyason. "One 24-year-old suspect, who is resident in the Kampies settlement, was caught and arrested. The other is still at large. The cellphone and a gas gun was recovered. "This is a positive development in the fight to bring those who have been terrorising bus commuters, by perpetrating opportunistic robberies on the buses, to book." Meanwhile, the City confirmed that a Law Enforcement officer was involved in a shooting incident in the central business district last night, said director for safety and security Richard Bosman. The matter has been taken over by the SAPS for investigation and the City is co-operating with the SAPS as well as the Independent Police Investigative Directorate, Bosman added. Cape Times
