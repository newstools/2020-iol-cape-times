Cape Town – City of Cape Town Rail Enforcement and Metal Theft Unit officers have arrested two women in connection with the removal of palisade fencing along a railway line in Kalksteenfontein. The officers had received a tip-off at about noon on Wednesday that palisade fencing was being stored at a house in Bonteheuwel. "Upon arrival at the location, they found six sections of metal fencing in the front of a house," said Dyason. "It was established that the fencing was stolen at Netreg station." Dyason said the two women were taken to the Bishop Lavis police station and charged with possession of stolen property and in terms of the Criminal Matters Amendment Act." Last September, the City of Cape Town's Rapid Response Unit and Facilities Protection officers thwarted the theft of the Manenberg Community Centre's metal fence. Two hacksaws were found in the bags of two suspects leaving the scene and the security guards at the site identified them as the alleged thieves. Two sawn steel poles were also recovered. The officers then went to a house in Sonderend Street in Manenberg and found two large sections of City palisade fencing on the property. They arrested a male suspect in connection with the theft. They recognised the suspect as someone they arrested in 2015 for cable theft. Cape Times
