Kwahlelo is a twin and police said their mother was approached by a suspect who presented herself as a social worker in Khayelitsha last week. The suspect asked for the baby’s birth certificate, clinic card and made herself copies. She then returned the next day and accompanied the mother and the children in a taxi to Parow, where she told the mother her office was. After stopping, the suspect got out of the vehicle and fled with the child. “The circumstances surrounding the kidnapping are being investigated and the assistance of the public will be appreciated so that the mother can be reunited with her child,” police spokesperson Andrè Traut said. Western Cape Missing Persons Unit director Candice van der Rheede said finding lost children took a community effort. “The public must stop walking past situations that don’t look right just because it’s not their child. If you see something, call the police. “When your gut tells you something, act on it and alert law enforcement,” Van der Rheede said. Anyone with information about Kwahlelo’s whereabouts can contact investigating officer Joy Sumsodien on 082 522 1095 or anonymously call Crime Stop on 08600 10111, or SMS Crime Line on 32211.
