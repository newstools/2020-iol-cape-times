Lucky was malnourished, incredibly weak, dehydrated and suffering from a painful skin condition when passing motorist Maria Lange saw three men dumping him on the side of the road. The incident occurred in early December, said SPCA spokesperson Belinda Abraham, who added that Lange reported it to law enforcement, who informed the SPCA. “Thanks to the kindness of a stranger, who witnessed the callous incident, the course of Lucky’s life was forever changed,” said Abraham. Lange had seen an animal in need and chose not to look away, instead offering compassion to this lost soul, Abraham said. “Once Lucky had been brought back to our animal clinic and was assessed and treated by our veterinarians, we were able to allow him some rest and recovery following his ordeal. “Today we can happily report that Lucky - now called Survivor - has been officially adopted and is going home with his new fur brother and mom.” Report any case of animal abandonment to the SPCA at 021 7004158/9 or after-hours at 083 326 1604.
