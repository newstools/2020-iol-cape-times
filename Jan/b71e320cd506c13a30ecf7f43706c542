The WPPA financial board member was reported missing on Saturday after he left his Edgemead home at 3.30am to attend the Stragglers Beachcomber race at the Strandfontein Pavilion, but did not arrive. The Cape Times yesterday heard from a reliable source that Barnes allegedly parked his car at a mall, and called an e-hailing service to drive him to the airport. Police spokesperson FC van Wyk would not divulge investigation information, only saying that detectives were following up on all leads. Barnes allegedly boarding a flight was a lead they were investigating, Van Wyk said. “We are still searching for him, he has still not been found. We are following up on all leads, the investigation continues,” Van Wyk said. Attempts to reach Barnes’ family yesterday were unsuccessful. Cape Town Sport Council chairperson Elton Davids, who has been handling media queries on behalf of Barnes’ family, said the family dismissed claims that he was in Johannesburg because police had not yet found him. Anyone with information on Barnes’ whereabouts can anonymously contact Crime Stop on 08600 10111 or SMS Crime Line on 32211. Cape Times
