Mayoral committee member for energy and climate change Phindile Maxiti said: “It is important to be as prepared as possible for Eskom’s load shedding and be energy-wise. "The City is trying its best to keep customers informed about load shedding as timeously as possible. “Notification from Eskom is often received at short notice Eskom has warned that the system remains severely constrained and unpredictable.” Stage 2 load shedding would continue until 6am today, Eskom confirmed yesterday. Owing to inadequate maintenance over a number of years, the system remains vulnerable to unplanned outages, the power utility said. “The system remains severely constrained and unpredictable, and as such load shedding Stage 2 will unfortunately have to continue from 8am (yesterday) until 6am (today). “We have lost additional generation capacity overnight with breakdowns of over 14 000MW. Our emergency reserves are also insufficient to meet the demand for electricity during the day. "As a result we have load shedding throughout the day until tomorrow (Friday),” Eskom said. Cape Times
