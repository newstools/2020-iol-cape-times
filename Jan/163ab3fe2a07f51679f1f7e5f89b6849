Cape Town – A tip-off helped City Metro Police officers seize about 100 dagga plants at a property in Macassar. The owner of the property was also found in possession of rubber bullets and a firearm with an expired licence, Metro Police spokesperson Ruth Solomons said. Illegal substances were also confiscated elsewhere in the metro, Solomons added. “In Parow, K9 Xena found drugs hidden in the kitchen of a known drug house. During a search of the property, Xena set off sniffing and led her handler to 113 grams of tik, a small quantity of mandrax tablets and a carrier bag of dagga. "Two women, aged 23 and 29, were arrested and detained at Parow SAPS," said Solomons. Meanwhile, the City's Law Enforcement officers have arrested a suspect for the possession of about 5kg of stolen railway signalling cables in Woodstock, which officials say is a hot spot for metal theft. “In Eerste River, officers attached to the Law Enforcement Rapid Response Unit were returning from an alarm response at a clinic when they saw three suspects carrying a roll of cable. "They stopped and the suspects fled. Much later the officers responded to another alarm and while travelling on the same road, saw one of the suspects looking for their abandoned stolen cable. "He was promptly arrested and charged,” said Law Enforcement spokesperson Inspector Wayne Dyason. Cape Times
