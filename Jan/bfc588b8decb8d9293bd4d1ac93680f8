Cape Town – Two housebreaking suspects were arrested in the early hours today in Table View. "A homeowner in Zeeland Street, Table View, was alerted by security officers that their garage door was standing wide open and, upon an inspection, noticed that numerous equipment was missing," Western Cape police spokesperson Mihlali Majikela said on Friday. On their way to investigate the housebreaking complaint, Table View police officers received information from another armed response company about two suspicious-looking men walking down a nearby street with backpacks. "The members went to the address where the two suspicious males were observed. They conducted a search of the two men, during which items possibly belonging to the homeowner were discovered in their backpacks. "The items found in the possession of the two men were later identified by the home owner as the stolen property. The suspects, aged 17 and 29, will remain in custody until their court appearance on Monday on charges related to housebreaking and possession of stolen property. Cape Times
