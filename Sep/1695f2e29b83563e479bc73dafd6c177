Cape Town - After a painstaking two-week assessment of fitness and competence, candidates shortlisted by the City of Cape Town for the upcoming lifeguard season will be among 600 seasonal lifeguards responsible for preventing drownings along the shoreline and pools this summer. In a statement released on Friday, Mayco member community services and health, Zahid Badroodien said that with an unpredictable summer ahead, lifeguards were preparing new safety and hygiene protocols. He said the City’s latest intake of swimming-pool lifeguards were put through their paces. “The City wants to ensure we have enough well-trained and qualified lifeguards on duty,” Badroodien said. He said the last two weeks of testing were conducted by the recreation and parks department at the Retreat indoor swimming pool. Badroodien said beach lifeguards will be tested on their abilities in the surf, not only during induction but throughout the period of employment. “By the very nature of their work, lifeguards put their own lives on the line to rescue others from drowning. We owe a debt of gratitude to our brave City lifeguards, who step forward and commit themselves to the process,” Badroodien said. Once the lifeguards are appointed, they will be employed with the City from October 2020 until April or June 2021. Badroodien said it was likely that swimming pool capacities would be limited in order to meet physical distancing requirements along with other national regulations set during the Covid-19 period. “The City is committed to making a success of the 2020/21 summer season and is looking forward to offering safe swimming spaces regardless of the uncertainties that we currently face. “We're looking forward to a safe season and we are proud of the lifeguards who will be stationed at the City’s open swimming pools and 29 beaches across the coast,” Badroodien said.
