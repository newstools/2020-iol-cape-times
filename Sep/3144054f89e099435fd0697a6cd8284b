Cape Town - The Oudtshoorn Municipality honoured law enforcement officer Donovan le Roux, who died of a Covid-19-related sickness, with a motorcade memorial service to his home. Le Roux, 47, died at the George Provincial Hospital on Saturday, after being admitted last month. He had joined the municipality in 2013. More than 100 vehicles participated, with mourners travelling from the traffic department offices where Le Roux worked, to his home in Eland Road in Bridgton. One person for every vehicle handed a wreath and flowers to Le Roux’s family. Among them was Greater Oudtshoorn mayor Chris Macpherson and acting municipal manager Gerald de Jager. Residents also stood along the road to pay their respects. A broadcast of the memorial service was streamed live on the municipality’s social media. De Jager said the motorcade was fitting to honour Le Roux as it enabled everyone to be part of the service while observing Covid-19 regulations. The traffic department was temporarily closed in the morning and opened later. Chief of Traffic Services and Law Enforcement Patrick Jordaan said Le Roux’s colleagues were devastated. “He was admitted to hospital on August 25, after complaining about not feeling well. His death is a huge loss for the municipality and law enforcement. We lost a reliable, honest person with great character who always did his job diligently. “His colleagues admired him for his modesty and introverted personality,” said Jordaan. Macpherson conveyed his condolences to Le Roux’s widow, Nicolene, and their two children. “We are deeply saddened by the passing of such a great colleague and we pray that the family, friends and colleagues may be comforted during this difficult time,” said Macpherson. Le Roux will be buried on Saturday. Cape Times
