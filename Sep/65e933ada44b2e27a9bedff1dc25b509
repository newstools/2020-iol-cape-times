Cape Town - Mr Deaf South Africa finalist Anesh Magan along with non-profit organisation Trio will be hosting a braai festival in celebration of Heritage and Deaf Awareness Month to distribute and feed the underprivileged on the Cape Flats. The festival will be along Thornton Road in Gleemoor, Athlone, on Thursday, and is set to begin at 10am. The proudly South African representative, who is the only Mr Deaf finalist from Cape Town, will be cooking alongside Ammarah Petersen from Hot Chefs, who is an award-winning top five Halaal Chef in the Western Cape. Magan, 43, said he was looking forward to bridging the gap between the deaf and hearing. “To merge something I enjoy with a talented chef is most definitely something to look forward to, especially that it is to feed our hungry fellow South Africans,” said Magan. Petersen said the food on the menu would be a representation of the country’s heritage. “I don’t think that there will be anything that takes preference besides a potjie for our heritage, because it is part of our oldest cooking techniques. “When the Voortrekkers first came to settle in Cape Town, they would move around with their cast iron pots and cook food. “That would be their dinner. I don’t think that Heritage Day would be the same without a potjie. “Hopefully, through our celebration we can inform and educate people about the history and story of potjie food, along with Mr Deaf South Africa.” Trio, who have been able to feed more than 50 000 people since the beginning of the lockdown, said their vision was to pay it forward to the underprivileged. The NPO also uplifts and empowers entry-level job-seekers through internships, and recently received meals from Rise Against Hunger and Aspire Youth at Maynard Mall to feed more than 10 000 people.
