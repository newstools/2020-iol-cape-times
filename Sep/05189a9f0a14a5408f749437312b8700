Cape Town - WITH a strong desire to help those around him, 10-year-old Joshua Roos, who runs a soup kitchen with his grandmother Manda, has appealed for donations to expand their efforts. Joshua, from Gordon’s Bay, hopes to raise R50 000 through a BackaBuddy campaign for his soup kitchen. He started it in 2018 and since then has fed thousands of needy in and around his community. Manda said: “I’m helping my grandson, Joshua from Joshua’s Soup Kitchen, to raise funds to help the less fortunate. He has helped various individuals and institutions. He started doing this because he saw a need when he saw people scratching in bins, which unsettled him. He even takes an extra sandwich to his school, which kids who don’t have lunch can go and collect from the school secretary.” Now with the aim of reaching more people and institutions in their community, Manda said she is counting on the charity of the public to continue the cause dear to Joshua’s heart. “We need funds to help buy food or for upgrading, and sometimes just to acknowledge our front-line personnel in the health and security forces. We constantly need funds to keep up with the latest demand by people who lost their jobs or people who struggle just with putting food on their table day to day,” the pair said on their BackaBuddy campaign. Reaching our target means that we will be able to help more people by putting food on their tables, and seeing that someone can at least go to bed with a full stomach, especially children and the elderly, and that will be an accomplishment “Buying food to create food parcels which consist of various items to make a few meals, and also to help with upgrades where needed at various institutions, and to have a back-up fund to be able to help in an emergency situation. When the lockdown ends one day, we would like to be able to have an event where we can treat the kids in my community, which we have done in the past,” they said.
