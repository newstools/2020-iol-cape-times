Cape Town – Eight suspected dairy truck hijackers are among several people who appeared in court yesterday for various crimes over the weekend. Police spokesperson FC Van Wyk said two trucks were targeted at about 3.50pm on Friday while making deliveries. The suspects allegedly demanded the drivers go to the back of the trucks, where they locked them in and ground open the safes. “A joint operation between the provincial integrated team and local SAPS was conducted at Mafila Street V71 and V72 Mbekweni after information was received on the whereabouts of the suspects and the stolen goods. ’’Eight suspects were found at the addresses and arrested for the hijacking incident and face charges of possession of stolen goods and dealing in dagga,” said Van Wyk. He added that on Friday and Saturday more than 60 suspects were arrested in Nyanga for the possession of drugs, dangerous weapons and other offences. “An assortment of drugs, cash, imitation firearms, hijacked vehicles and stolen property was also recovered. ’’Members were applauded for their swift response, vigilance and endeavours in ensuring the offenders were brought to book,” said Van Wyk. Among the people arrested were three suspects aged 16, 19 and 22 who allegedly broke into a house in Lower Crossroads. “Members who were on patrol received information about stolen property at an address and responded swiftly. Upon arrival they recovered two flat-screen TVs and a monitor,” he said. The suspects are expected to appear in the Athlone Magistrate’s Court soon. Nearby, a 43-year-old suspect was arrested on Saturday at about 10.20pm for the possession of suspected stolen property. Electronics and jewellery stolen from a home in Manyano Street, Crossroads were allegedly recovered. Cape Times
