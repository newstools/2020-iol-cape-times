Cape Town - For the past two years the by-invitation-only Great Optimist Race has been held in Cape Town, and has involved experienced sailors, celebrities and medical survivors sailing for charity and the work of the Little Optimist Trust. But the Covid pandemic meant the postponement of Boatica Cape Town 2020, the traditional race host. But instead of cancelling the race, a new global “Covid-compliant” challenge has been launched. Sailors of any age from across the country and around the world will be able to sign up for The Little Optimist Global Race, and raise funds for charity at the same time. Anyone who has ever sailed has been invited to climb aboard an Optimist sailing dinghy and take part. It is open to anyone of any age, anywhere in the world – as long as you can sail. Participants will be required to sail any “Opti” for an hour or more on any body of water, anywhere in the world – during the race window of October 9-18. Each boat will be able to raise funds for charity, which will be split between the sailor’s chosen cause, and the Little Optimist Trust, which hosts sailing therapy days for disadvantaged children. “I’m so excited to challenge everyone to climb into a Little Optimist children’s dinghy, and sail it for charity, fun and inspiration,” said founder Greg Bertish. “Even Covid will not stop the Little Optimist and his friends from sailing to raise funds for our foundation and many others.” The initiative raised R300 000 for The New ICU at Red Cross War Memorial Children’s Hospital.
