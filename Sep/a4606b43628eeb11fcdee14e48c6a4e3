George police have launched a 72-hour plan to arrest the two suspects behind the murder of 23-year-old shopkeeper Misheck Jemitalla when they robbed a spaza shop in Touwsranten near Wilderness, George. Police spokesperson Malcolm Pojie said preliminary investigations found that the shop, in Begonia Street, Touwsranten was still trading at about 7.40pm on Friday when the suspects wearing face masks and one armed with what seemed to be a 9mm black pistol, stormed the shop and closed the entrance door. The suspects were described to be in their late 20s, both of slender build and about 1.75 metres tall. “The suspects opened fire without any warning. One of the bullets hit the 23-year-old shop assistant in the chest. He succumbed to the injury. The assailants robbed two customers of their cellphones before they fled towards the dense bushes on foot after taking a substantial amount of cash from the cash register.” Forensic experts confiscated three 9mm spent cartridges on scene when they combed it for evidence and clues, he said. “The Eden Cluster Commander, Major General Oswald Reddy and senior members visited the scene and immediately activated the 72-hour plan to bring the suspects to book. He has condemned the action of these culprits in the strongest terms possible and made an appeal to the community to be vigilant at all times and to come forward with information that can assist the investigating officer,” said Pojie.
