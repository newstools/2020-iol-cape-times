Cape Town - Repairs to damages allegedly caused by protesting CPUT students are under way at the South Point Orchard residence in Bellville. Earlier this month, following a protest over services, CPUT students living at the residence were evicted, with building management saying damages amounting to more than R1 million were caused. South Point had also applied for an urgent court interdict that saw a number of the students appearing in court and released on bail. South Point chief executive Ndumiso Davidson said while they were starting repair work, their concern was the injuries inflicted on staff members. “We’ve lost two vehicles, one completely burnt out. Our sponsored student bicycles were also burnt, while fire-fighting equipment, CCTV, and other security equipment were damaged. Our administration offices were flooded, with fires set in and around the building – including the entrance to our building manager’s residence, with his wife and children aged 5 and 10 inside. “Windows were also smashed, and turnstiles were destroyed – all causing more than R1 million in damages to property. But our biggest concern remains the injuries to South Point staff and contractors, as well as endangering the lives of staff members and their families, and hundreds of other students.” Davidson said the students protested over a number of demands, including free wi-fi, electricity and laundry services. Bellville SA Students Congress chairperson Nanga Codana said there was no proof students damaged the property. Cape Times
