Cape Town – Metrorail has extended operations on the Southern Line by adding the Muizenberg and Fish Hoek stations to its weekday rail services. Initially trains in this corridor only operated between Cape Town and Retreat station. Based on the infrastructure that could still accommodate the train service following vandalism in other corridors, the Southern Line was the first to fully operate in the province. Metrorail spokesperson Riana Scott said in line with level 2 lockdown regulations, train capacity has been increased to 70%. “The number of single and return tickets available for sale has been adjusted accordingly. Turnaround times at Cape Town and Fish Hoek stations are extended to accommodate sanitising of trains. No weekend services will be offered until the demand warrants it,” she said. Scott said to ensure compliance, access to stations and platforms would be monitored by customer services staff and security personnel. Metrorail acting regional manager Raymond Maseko said to date no Covid-19 cases had been recorded on trains or at stations. The Cape Flats line resumed last month for the first time since the start of the lockdown in March with 13 trains running from Cape Town to Heathfield. Transport Minister Fikile Mbalula yesterday launched the Prasa's ministerial security plan following the appointment of 3 100 security personnel. The United National Transport Union said it was optimistic about the new security plan. Its general secretary Steve Harris said: “Today is the beginning of a journey to ensure the vision that trains are restored to being the backbone of South Africa's transport system.” Cape Argus
