Cape Town – An unemployed mother living in Delft says she is struggling to take care of her disabled daughter alone. Fortunate Makamba’s daughter, Alice Chitsuro, 23, has osteogenesis imperfecta and the two share a two-roomed shack. Makamba fled Zimbabwe in 2012 in pursuit of a better life for her daughter and to be free from the stigma that surrounds raising a child with a disability. “The struggle of being a mother of a woman who needs care around the clock is not understood by many. “Another factor is that nobody comes to your aid, and as a mother, you are supposed to work and at the same time take care of the child. “My migration was basically for the love for my family,” she said. Since the wheels of the wheelchair that was donated to Chitsuro years ago broke because it was too small for her, Makamba said she was battling to lift her daughter when she wanted to use the bathroom or to go to sit outside. “Sometimes she also wants to move in and outside the house but she can’t because I’m struggling to lift her because she is big now. “So she stays in the house always, with nowhere to go, even to see the outside. She sometimes asks me how the outside looks nowadays,” Makamba said. The desperate mother appealed to anyone to help her with a wheelchair for her daughter or a job. “If anyone helps me with a wheelchair for my child, I would appreciate it. “Even to give me a job so that I can also bring food for her because I am a caregiver, but there's no job for me now,” she said Although she cannot walk, to make ends meet her daughter makes beads, which she sells for R20. “Alice is able to do some things while sitting in the house like beading. And she is able to use a laptop because she went to a school for the blind. “She is a very brilliant woman who just needs educational opportunities. “I wish she could study whatever she wants and be able to realise her dreams,” the mother said.
