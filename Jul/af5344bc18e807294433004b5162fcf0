Cape Town – A 58-year-old man who endured nine days at sea after a suspected heart attack is recovering in Vincent Pallotti Hospital and is in a “stable condition and lucky to have survived”. ER24 spokesperson Ross Campbell said the man was aboard a fishing vessel travelling from Tristan da Cunha, in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean, when he is believed to have suffered a suspected acute myocardial infarction. “ER24 paramedics were dispatched to Cape Town Harbour following the request for a transfer from a private hospital in the area. “Arriving just before 9pm, paramedics reported that the patient was in stable condition and lucky to have survived. He was transferred through to high care for treatment,” said Campbell. In another rescue operation, the National Sea Rescue Institute (NSRI) in Yzerfontein saved a fishing vessel from sinking. Station commander Willem Lubbe said that duty crew were activated following reports of a local fishing vessel with 10 crew on board taking on water nine nautical miles offshore of Yzerfontein on Saturday. “On arrival at the scene, we found a fellow fishing vessel standing by to assist if necessary, with the casualty fishing vessel lying deep in the water, heavy laden from the intake of water reportedly coming from a leaking seal. “Efforts were under way by the fishing crew to recover her fishing nets that were deployed in the water and the fellow fishing vessel Towerkop assisted the casualty fishing vessel crew to lift and recover her fishing nets,” he said. Lubbe said two NSRI rescue swimmers were transferred on to the casualty fishing vessel and the water extrication pump was put to work pumping water free while the fishing crew replaced a leaking seal. “At 12.30pm NSRI were released from the scene and the casualty vessel motored to St Helena Bay Harbour accompanied by her fellow fishing vessel, Towerkop. There were no injuries reported,” he said. Cape Times
