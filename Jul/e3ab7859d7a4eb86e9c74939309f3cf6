Cape Town – A Delft taxi operator is the latest victim of the taxi violence plaguing the province. The 35-year-old driver was shot and killed early yesterday morning at Eindhoven taxi rank after two unidentified men approached the area and randomly fired shots at taxi drivers congregating at the rank. The suspects remain at large. Police spokesperson Noloyiso Rwexana said a case of murder had been opened for investigation by Delft police. The shooting came a day after Transport and Public Works MEC Bonginkosi Madikizela met with the provincial SA National Taxi Council leadership and taxi associations to find solutions to ongoing shootings. Since the start of the year about 44 taxi-related murders and 20 attempted murders have been reported in high-risk areas including Mbekweni in Paarl, Delft, Bellville, Bloekombos, Ceres, Masiphumelele and Nyanga. “It's very unfortunate and disappointing to hear about the passing of a driver in the industry who was killed following fruitful engagements on Wednesday. "We'll continue to engage the leadership and associations regarding their taxi issue. Our fear is that innocent people will be affected by this,” said Madikizela. He said animosity between either the Cape Town Taxi Association and/or Codeta and affiliated associations ran deep but this was no excuse for the killings. Cape Times
