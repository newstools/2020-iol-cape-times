Cape Town – The SA Liquor Brandowners Association (Salba) has appealed for better policing at stores to prevent more looting. In the latest incident caught on video, stock was stolen at OK Liquor in Highbury, Kuils River. A large number of people are seen gathering around the small glass door at the entrance, trying to enter after having broken it with what appear to be bricks. Salba chief executive Kurt Moore said they feared that when the ban on alcohol was reinstated, with no warning, looting and unrest in communities would ensue. During the first ban under the country's Covid-19 lockdown, at least 16 liquor outlets in the Western Cape were looted. “The alcohol industry is concerned about the recent spate of break-ins at liquor retail outlets during the current ban on the sale and transport of alcohol. The alcohol industry is appealing to the government for better policing,” Moore said. Provincial police spokesperson, Novela Potelwa, said a case of malicious damage to property, burglary and theft was opened for investigation. “A group of about 200 persons stormed a liquor store in Highbury Street in Kuils River. “They helped themselves to the liquor. An ATM located nearby and other shops were also vandalised. As the investigation continues, the perpetrators are yet to be arrested. “There were also reports today of public violence in Delft and Mfuleni where roads were barricaded with burning tyres.” Anyone with information can anonymously contact Crime Stop on 08600 10111 or SMS Crime Line on 32211.
