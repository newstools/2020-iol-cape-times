Community Safety Minister Albert Fritz said: “I commend the WCLA on their consistent efforts to prevent alcohol-related harm and ensure there are enough beds in our hospitals for those who need it most I call on residents to report transgressions.” Of the 34 suspended licences, one suspension was extended pending a section 20 consideration, while the LLT lifted 30 suspensions, the high court one and an internal Appeal Tribunal another. “Of the 30 suspensions that were uplifted, these matters may be returned to the LLT for those cases where prima facie evidence exists for any contraventions in terms of the WCLA.” Meanwhile, in Klapmuts, a raid was carried out and two arrests made with the assistance of armed response company Fidelity ADT. Cape Town North district manager at Fidelity ADT, Verena Hulme, said: “Our team received a request for assistance from the Klapmuts SAPS on Friday.
