Maré, 50, is accused of raping a 14-year-old girl after a photo shoot on June 24. He also faces sexual assault charges for possession and creation of child pornography. National Prosecuting Authority spokesperson Eric Ntabazalila confirmed Maré made his second court appearance yesterday, where his bail application was partly heard. The hearing continues tomorrow, said Ntabazalila. The State will oppose bail. Cape Town detectives from the Family Violence, Child and Sexual Offences Unit and the Provincial Serial and Electronic Crimes Unit launched a search and seizure operation at the modelling agency in Loop Street, after which Maré was arrested. Following his arrest, police called on all victims of sexual violence in the modelling industry in Cape Town to come forward. Women and children rights activist Roegshanda Pascoe said many advocacy groups are monitoring the case and oppose bail for Maré. “We note with concern how quickly the accused is applying for bail and the bail hearing is going ahead,” said Pascoe. Requests for comments from the agency remained unanswered by deadline Any victim of sexual violence through the modelling agency is urged to contact investigating officer Graham Davids at 082 522 1086.
