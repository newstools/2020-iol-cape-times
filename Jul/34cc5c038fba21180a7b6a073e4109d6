Johannesburg - Mineral Resources Minister Gwede Mantashe has been admitted to hospital just days after contracting Covid-19.

Cabinet spokesperson Phumla Williams said the minister was admitted to hospital earlier on Monday. “Minister Mantashe was admitted to hospital on the advice of their family doctor for better medical attention and monitoring, whilst Mrs Mantashe will continue to self-quarantine at their home,” said Williams. “We will continue to give the Mantashe family all the support they need during this time. We wish both Minister and Mrs Mantashe a speedy recovery from this invisible enemy and we are quite confident that they will emerge victorious against the coronavirus,” she said.
