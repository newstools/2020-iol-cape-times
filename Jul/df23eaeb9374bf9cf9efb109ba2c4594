The Health Professions Council of SA (HPCSA) said it noted with “grave concern” the continuing trend by registered practitioners to employ unregistered locums to work in their practices. “The HPCSA and law enforcement agencies are working tirelessly to eradicate the illegal health care practice of bogus health care practitioners,” it said. Kishule Prosper Bataciramwira, who made his first court appearance on July 16, was nabbed in Kraaifontein operating from the practise of Dr ECA Mensah. “The HPCSA’s Inspectorate Office in Cape Town collaborated with the Kraaifontein SAPS in conducting an inspection at the practice of Mensah in Kraaifontein. "The team found Bataciramwira practising as a medical doctor and consulting with patients while not registered with Council. Bataciramwira was arrested and detained at the Kraaifontein SAPS,” the HPCSA said. The public has been urged to report suspicious illegal practices by unregistered persons. “Registered practitioners should refrain from employing unregistered locums as this poses a risk and endangers the lives of the public," the HPCSA said. Police spokesperson Andrè Traut confirmed the arrest. “A man, 45, was arrested in Kraaifontein for practising as a doctor while not registered as a medical practitioner."
