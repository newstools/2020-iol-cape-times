Cape Town – The Mfuleni family of slain SACP member Siyabulele Siswana said they had yet to find closure following the murder of the father and his 6-year-old daughter, Banele. Siswana’s family were ambushed in their Extension 6 house on July 1 when two men whose faces were concealed entered and randomly opened fire. The 44-year-old father and his daughter died on arrival at a health facility, and his 39-year-old wife is still recovering in hospital after being wounded in a hail of bullets. Five other children managed to run for cover to their rooms and survived the attack. Siswana’s uncle, Mntuwekhaya, said they did not know the motive behind the attack. “We laid Siyabulela and Banele to rest this weekend, and the reason for delaying the funeral is because we had hoped his wife would be discharged by then. “She was moved from the trauma unit to another ward last week. She is really heartbroken that she couldn’t bury the people she loves. Maybe that could have brought some kind of closure. “We are still scrambling for answers because we don’t know if there might be another attack,” he said. Provincial police spokesperson Brigadier Novela Potelwa previously said provincial detectives were interviewing several individuals in an investigation into the murders. Rwexana this week said there were no new developments. SACP provincial secretary Benson Ngqentsu said Siswana was a peace-maker and dedicated leader.
