Cape Town – The parents of missing 12-year-old, Lunamandla Sitonga, who was last seen being dropped off at school, say they are struggling to cope as each day passes and they don’t know where their child is. Lunamandla, fondly known as Luna, was last seen by her mother Anela Jack on the morning of July 9, boarding her school transport in front of their Site B home in TR Section, Khayelitsha. The Grade 6 pupil, who has short hair and carries a black Nike school bag, never made it to her classroom at Eastville Primary School in Mitchells Plain. “I am not okay at all, I’m hanging on to the hope that whoever has her will grow a conscience and bring her back. “The family has been struggling, we sit and just look at each other because we can’t keep a conversation going, let alone eat. I stopped eating long ago because I don’t know what my child is eating.” Police spokesperson Mihlali Majikela said they were investigating the disappearance of Lunamandla and 13-year-old Siliziwe Dlodlo from Browns Farm in Philippi, who was last seen at about 5pm on July 20. According to reports, her mother woke up and found that the child did not sleep at home. Siliziwe was last seen wearing a long grey T-shirt and Adidas takkies. Member of the Pink Ladies organisation, Veranique Williams, said: “The organisation is still conducting searches for children. There is no waiting period for a missing child. “Report to any police station when you notice your child is missing.” Anyone with information about Lunamandla is urged to contact Mitchells Plain’s detective sergeant Mankono on 082 522 1066 and for Siliziwe, contact Nyanga’s officer Vetman on 082 302 0595.
