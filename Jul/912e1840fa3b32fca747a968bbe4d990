“This breakthrough was achieved through an integrated intelligence-driven operation on Tuesday in Knysna and Plettenberg Bay by Eden Cluster CIG and Knysna SAPS,” said police spokesperson Christopher Spies. This after police received information which led them to a house in Hornlee. On searching the premises, officers found two batteries hidden in a room. “Further investigation resulted in the additional discovery of empty gas cylinders, a range of power tools and electrical equipment. “Further leads took the police to separate houses in Concordia and Kwanokuthula where three more batteries, two and one respectively, were confiscated. "Subsequently, two suspects were arrested for the possession of suspected stolen items. They are currently in custody and scheduled to appear in the Knysna Magistrate's Court as soon as they are charged.” Meanwhile, Cape Town Crime Prevention Unit members arrested two suspects aged 32 and 35 found in possession of an imitation firearm, a grinder, housebreaking and car-breaking implements, suspected stolen cellphones and tik in Vredehoek on Monday.
