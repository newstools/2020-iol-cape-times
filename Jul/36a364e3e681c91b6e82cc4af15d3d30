Local NGO Living Through Learning yesterday donated 300 food parcels and learning material to Blossom Street and Sonwabo primary schools. Donated food included rice, samp, tea, coffee, sugar, porridge, toilet rolls, pilchards, bath soap, Melsi soya mince, beef, and cooking oil. NGO director Sonja Botha said they were looking forward to distributing more food parcels to schools around the City during the lockdown. “(During) this lockdown we did not stop working but we could not do education, so we got involved with food deliveries in the communities like Delft. “In two months we have fed about 10000 children. We give them little booklets where they can do activities and read. “Lunch Box gave us 300 boxes, each box is valued around R300. “We have to stay motivated, we have to keep helping especially with parents not being employed and there is hunger out there, you can’t teach a hungry child and that is why we sort of diversified a little into feeding and teaching because they go hand in hand,” said Botha. Acting principal at Blossom Street Primary Rodney Layman agreed the community was in need. “The donations today by Living Through Learning were great. “Our learners come from different places such as Gugulethu, Khayelitsha, Philippi and Silvertown, a vast area. “Especially now during this time of Covid-19, it has affected our economy so badly and most of the parents are sitting home, they have not been working for months since the lockdown started.” For some families, the food parcel would be the only food they received. “They have also donated data so that children can be able to do school work from home,” said Layman.
