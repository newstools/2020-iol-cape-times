Gape Town – Groote Schuur Hospital pharmacists Melissa Singh and Wendy Smith, who are among 70 employees in the department, have been recognised as heroes for their selfless work for others. Singh, 34, from Milnerton, has worked at the hospital for eight months, while Smith, 49, from Kirstenhof, boasts 26 years of service. As pharmacists, their essential duties include making sure patients get the correct medication. This includes dispensing of medication to inpatients as well as outpatients. They also interact with other professionals regarding queries for patients, and guide interns. “The department has been forced to become virtual in terms of getting scripts to patients in Covid-19 wards,” the duo said. “Pharmacists were forced to be more flexible and come up with ways to serve Covid-19 patients better. “All this has to be done while still serving the other non-Covid patients, too. The big lesson learnt is that the pharmacy needs an e-dispensing programme,” they continued. Singh said she is inspired to help people, which she finds fulfilling. “Every day is a new learning experience and that is exciting,” she said. Smith said she loves her job and making a difference in her profession. When it came to how the hospital has accommodated their needs, Singh and Smith said management had pressures to deal with, and have done their best in stressful times. “With the resources, they have made minor changes, and this was done to consider the bigger picture. “We as staff feel safe, and emotionally, we also have been included in courses to help us deal with any issues. “There has been lots of fear for Covid-19, but management has teams come into our area to talk to us about Covid-19 and made sure we have all the PPE we needed.” Cape Times
