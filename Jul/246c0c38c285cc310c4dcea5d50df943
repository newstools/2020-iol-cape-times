Hawks spokesperson Philani Nkwalase said the four were arrested on Friday and were aged between 17 and 39. They included Mzuvukile Hlahleni’s girlfriend, Aphiwe Potwana, and resident Nonjongo Tabalaza. Hlahleni worked at the Steenberg police station and was killed at his home in Khayelitsha, allegedly after an argument with his girlfriend. “It is alleged that Hlahleni was stoned to death by family members of his girlfriend and some members of the community close to the family.” The case against the two teens was postponed until tomorrow for assessments, and the two were released into the care of their parents. The two adults remain in police custody and their case was postponed until July 13 for bail information. Hlahleni’s sister, Babalwa Fanta, said seeing the accused in court was not easy, but the family would continue to go to court to seek justice for her brother. “We went as a family and we are still very hurt, especially when we saw them. These are kids that did this. “But what we want now is for justice to be done for Mzuvukile.” Hlahleni was his mother’s only son and Fanta said his mother was not coping well. Cape Times
