Cape Town – A donated wheelchair has given Alice Chitsuro her independence back, said the 23-year-old, who is living with osteogenesis imperfecta. Following the Cape Times sharing her plight this week, a Good Samaritan has donated a new wheelchair to Chitsuro, who shares a two-roomed shack in Delft with her mother, Fortunate Makamba. “I want to thank you very much for the wheelchair. I am able to go to the bathroom alone and move around the house doing what I want, myself. “I am so happy, and for those who are pledging to give us food hampers. Things are now getting easier for me.” Makamba had been battling to take care of Chitsuro since the wheels of the wheelchair that was donated to her years ago broke last year. The mother said she struggled to lift her daughter when she wanted to use the bathroom or to go and sit outside. “Immediately after the Cape Times published the story about my child, I received calls from many people asking how I am coping with life. “I received several calls asking if they can come and drop a wheelchair. I got one from a resident from Somerset West. People are still phoning, asking how they can assist,” she said. Chitsuro and Makamba left Zimbabwe in 2012 to seek better opportunities. The grateful mother said the new wheelchair had brought joy into her daughter’s eyes, and she was now an independent woman. “She is now able to go around on her own. Instead of her spending time all day in the house, she can also go outside. “I can also take my child to the shops, I can take her to the church. I am really relieved,” said Makamba. Cape Times
