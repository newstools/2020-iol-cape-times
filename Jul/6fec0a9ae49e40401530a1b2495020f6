Cape Town – Former Hout Bay poacher Angelo Joseph said he was grateful to see the smiles on the faces of children at St Helena Bay Primary this week following a handover of much-needed hygiene products. Joseph and his colleague Louis Gardiner travelled to the West Coast school on Tuesday to provide thermometers, sanitisers, bleach and copy paper, among other items, on behalf of diving and salvage company Guerrini Marine Construction (GMC). In 2017, a group of men from Hout Bay and Hangberg, among them Joseph, received training thanks to the Department of Public Works, local company Guerrini Marine Construction (GMC) and dive school Jack’s Dive Chest to empower them to make a legal living using their existing skills and scuba experience. Once qualified, they assisted in removing sunken wrecks congesting parts of Hout Bay Harbour, with one of the divers later able to open a diving business. GMC earlier this year carried out a contract for the dredging of Hout Bay and Gordon's Bay. The company identified four vulnerable schools and decided to assist them, starting with St Helena Bay Primary. Joseph said they were looking to empower the youth and the vulnerable. “As a person who comes from a disadvantaged background I know how it feels to have nothing, so I'm grateful to be able to see the smiles on the children's faces and I'm thankful for the opportunity to do this,” he said. Joseph said this also gave him hope for a brighter future for the youth. “I am not a poacher any more because I was assisted and now I am part of a team and company that is helping the disadvantaged,” he said. Gardiner said many were faced with hardships as a result of Covid-19. “Today was part of an initiative with bigger plans to empower our people,” he said. Cape Times
