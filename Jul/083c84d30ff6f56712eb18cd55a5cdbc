Cape Town – Sametime, the dog viciously attacked by his owner’s partner in a domestic dispute, has died. The animal’s owner, who recently left her abusive relationship, had reported a case of animal cruelty against her former partner last week. In retaliation, the man allegedly set the woman’s home on fire and stabbed her dog in the neck, according to the Cape of Good Hope SPCA. Police spokesperson Noloyiso Rwexana said a 44-year-old was arrested last weekend after his girlfriend laid charges of malicious damage to property. “A further charge of animal cruelty was opened with Athlone SAPS after he attacked and stabbed the girlfriend’s dog,” she said. Sametime was in a critical condition and the organisation said he died on Wednesday as a result of his injuries. Spokesperson Belinda Abraham said they were heartbroken over the dog’s death. “It is our greatest wish that we never have to see a dog so gravely injured by human hands ever again. “RIP Sametime, we promise you that we will speak loudly for you in court and do everything within our power to get justice for you.” Abraham said the man who was allegedly responsible would appear in court this month on charges of animal cruelty and malicious damage to property. “We will represent you in court on that day and do our best to ensure that he never gets the opportunity to hurt another animal ever again,” said Abraham. She said it was unfortunate that incidents like this were not uncommon, as intimate partners would often use animal mistreatment as a tactic when their partner had a valued bond with their animal.
