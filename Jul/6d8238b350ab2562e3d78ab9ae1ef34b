Cape Town – Two minors were among 11 Delft residents arrested inside the Roosendal Liquor Store after allegedly being found in possession of alcohol. The area was declared a hot spot by the police after a large crowd looted the store on Tuesday, dismantled an ATM and barricaded a road with debris. In a video, people are seen trying to force open the store’s front door. After succeeding, they steal a large amount of alcohol. When the police arrived, several shelves had been emptied and broken bottles lay on the floor. Police spokesperson Brigadier Novela Potelwa said the suspects were expected to appear in the Blue Downs Magistrate’s Court soon. “Overnight reports of a break-in, looting and damage to property were reported on Delft Main Road. “Eleven suspects were arrested for malicious damage to property, burglary and looting a liquor store after they were found inside the store with liquor. “The SAPS in the province appeals to communities to abide by the law. Destruction of property and violent behaviour will be dealt with harshly,” Potelwa said. SA Liquor Brandowners Association chief executive Kurt Moore said holding stock in retail outlets created a security risk for retailers. They were working with suppliers and manufacturers to transfer stock back to central depots as quickly as possible. “The alcohol industry is appealing to the government for better policing to prevent theft. “Our industry was given no warning about the ban, nor an opportunity to consult with the National Coronavirus Command Centre before a decision was made. “No consideration was given to the immediate logistical difficulties it poses for suppliers, distributors and retailers,” Moore said.
