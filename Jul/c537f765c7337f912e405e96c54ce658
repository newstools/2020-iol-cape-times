In Mpumalanga, 1 046 murders were reported, followed by the Free State with 939 murders and Limpopo (882). There were 864 murders in North West and 326 in the Northern Cape. National police commissioner Khehla Sitole said they have been able to stabilise some provinces. “From the stabilisation and normalisation point of view, three provinces have been stabilised. We have stabilised the Western Cape, Eastern Cape and Gauteng. The province now of focus is KZN,” said Sitole. Police Minister Bheki Cele said there has been an increase of 1.4% in the number of murders committed in the country over the past three years. Thirty-three more people have been murdered in South Africa, with the murder rate rising to 21 325, an increase of 1.4%. Looking at the murder rate over a 10-year period, 15 893 people were murdered in 2010/11, with it rising to 20 336 in 2017/18 by 1 320 (the biggest increase during this period). A total of 73 police officials were killed during 2019/20, of which 35 were on-duty and 38 off-duty. The highest number of on-duty police officers were killed in Gauteng (11), and KwaZulu-Natal (11) recorded the highest fatality rate among off-duty police officers. Regarding the location where the murders were committed, the majority took place in a public place such as a street, open field, recreational centre, park, beach, abandoned building or parking area (9 712); 5 522 occurred at the residence of the perpetrator or victim (or at a place known by the perpetrator and victim); 853 at liquor outlets; 467 at business premises; 232 in various modes of transport such as a taxi, plane, bus, car or boat; and 133 on agricultural land (farm, plot or small holding).
