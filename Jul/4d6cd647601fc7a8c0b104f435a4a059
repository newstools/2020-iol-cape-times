Cape Town – Suspects who vandalised and burgled Eastridge Clinic, making off with copper pipes, have caused extensive water and electrical damage to the building. The intruders entered the facility on Sunday by gaining entry through the roof. The clinic's sexual reproductive health services were moved to the Mitchells Plain Day Hospital due to the damage. Mayoral committee member for community services Zahid Badroodien said the City was investigating and the total damage was still being assessed. “The facility has an active alarm system and perimeter sensors. We are investigating the response to the alarm activation,” said Badroodien. Police spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Andrè Traut said the suspects were yet to be arrested. “This office can confirm that a burglary was perpetrated at a Mitchells Plain clinic. “The suspects gained entry through the roof and removed copper pipes. The circumstances surrounding the incident are being investigated,” said Traut. Ward councillor Solomon Philander said they would use CCTV cameras to identify the suspects. “Services at the clinic went well even though it started a bit later because of this vandalism. "What is more concerning is that the clinic is next to the police station. “The street lights have also been vandalised. When a clinic is being vandalised, those who are in need of the services, such as medical attention, suffer the most. "The staff members at the clinic managed to provide services to the community under these crises. We will, together with the SAPS and provincial government, arrest the perpetrators. "I condemn such acts by those few individuals who want to take things to the losing side by destroying facilities. “This is happening for the first time after a long time. The last time we had such an incident was when a shooting occurred at the clinic,“ said Philander. Anyone with information can anonymously contact Crime Stop on 0860010111 or SMS Crime Line on 32211.
