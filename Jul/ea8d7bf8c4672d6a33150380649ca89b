Cape Town – The Western Cape Education Department has appealed to schools for the use of their facilities to ensure matric pupils are able to write their exams while adhering to physical distancing. The appeal was made in a letter by the head of the department, Brian Schreuder. “The WCED is aiming to limit the number of candidates writing in an examination centre. Primary and special schools, with halls, large dining halls or a gymnasium suitable for accommodating learners for the November 2020 National Senior Certificate exams, are requested to make these facilities available for the conducting of the exams,” said Schreuder. He said schools would be remunerated for the use of their facilities at a rate of R300 per day. WCED spokesperson Bronagh Hammond said the May-June supplementary exams were delayed due to the Covid-19 pandemic, and the dates when they would be written had yet to be announced. To assist pupils, the WCED has provided lessons in every subject on a weekly basis to all schools during the lockdown, and plans to continue providing the lessons beyond the lockdown. Revision material has also been provided. “Subject specialists and subject advisors are also providing revision programmes in all subjects - through printed material, on WhatsApp and online from the WCED ePortal. “The latter is also the platform where Grade 12s can get other quality assured subject resources, lessons, old question papers and memoranda, to mention a few. This is continuously updated,” Hammond said. Cape Times
