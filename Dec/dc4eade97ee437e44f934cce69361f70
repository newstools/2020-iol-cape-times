Cape Town – The Good Party has called for an investigation into the legality of what it described as “cadre deployments” following new appointments of senior officials in the George municipality. The municipality announced the council would appoint Michelle Gratz as acting municipal manager and Allen Paulse as acting director of community services from next month. Gratz worked at George municipality for 12 years before serving as municipal manager at the Mossel Bay municipality for seven years, the council said. Paulse had 18 years experience as a municipal manager, it said. The appointments come after Trevor Botha and Walter Hendricks, who had held the positions, recently terminated their contracts with immediate effect. Botha cited “relentless political attacks, vexatious, frivolous, baseless allegations and investigations” following his resignation. The municipality said they resigned as they faced disciplinary hearings. Local government MEC Anton Bredell's spokesperson, James-Brent, referred questions to the municipality. “The (Cogta) minister does not and cannot by law make municipal appointments. Only a municipality has that authority,” he said. The municipality promised to respond to questions today. Cape Times
