Cape Town – Described as always giving of his time and lending a helping hand, Cape Town’s long-serving late Noon Gun operator, Chief Petty Officer Dudley Malgas, will be missed by all who knew him, his family and friends said. Speaking on behalf of his widow Estelle, who was too distraught to speak to the media yesterday, Malgas’s goddaughter and niece, Lynn Mfenyana, said her uncle died at 4am yesterday, after Estelle rushed him to hospital. Malgas, 60, was in the navy for 39 years, for 22 of which he was in charge of setting off the Mother City’s famously loud Noon Gun, until he retired in September last year. Malgas had a liver disorder, which he was being treated for, but picked up Covid-19 about three months ago. Mfenyana said he had been in and out of 2 Military Hospital in Wynberg over the past few weeks, and was attached to oxygen until his passing. “Uncle Dud was a ‘people person’. He always gave so much of his time to the broader community, he was involved with the church and soccer club. He planned to travel (around) the country with his wife,” Mfenyana said. She said they planned to bury him on Saturday, at the Lutheran Church in Strand Street. Malgas leaves Estelle, two biological daughters from a previous marriage, and Estelle’s four sons. Bo-Kaap tour guide Bilqees Baker said she would always recommend and take people up to the Noon Gun, where Malgas would be eager to help and show tourists how operations were run. Former Vista High School deputy principal Ismail Esau said Malgas was on the school governing body when his son was there – a role in which he was very involved. “His passing is very sad news. He played a major role at the school. He was well loved,” Esau said. Cape Times
