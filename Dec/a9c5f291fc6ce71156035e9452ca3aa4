Cape Town - The Red Cross War Memorial Children’s Hospital (RCWMCH) has called on the wider community and corporates to assist with donations this festive season. The hospital is appealing to all to make children a priority this festive season as they have endured tough times. Acting chief executive of the RCWMCH, Dr Anita Parbhoo said: “Children are also feeling exhausted, and even more so those having to spend their time in hospital - especially during the festive season. “For those who have given to the hospital in the past, please consider making this festive season brighter for our young patients. Obviously, some toys would be great for the patients. “However, one sometimes overlooked need is that of food parcels for the patients to take home when they’re discharged. “It allows parents to ensure the patient is well nourished while also allowing them some wiggle room to actually be part of their children’s recovery at home without having to rush off to work to put food on the table that night.” RCWMCH has asked that all donations for the children be made directly to the hospital, as they were no longer associated with the Friends of the Children’s Hospital Association (FOCHA). To assist, people can contact Carla Brown at 021 658 5196 or rxh.volunteers@westerncape.gov.za “Alternatively, you can support the Red Cross War Memorial Children’s Hospital and our patients through our programmes and infrastructure projects by donating financially, or in kind,” the hospital said. * Contact the Children’s Hospital Trust on 021 686 7860 or cht@chtrust.org.za, or visit https://www.childrenshospitaltrust.org.za/ Cape Argus
