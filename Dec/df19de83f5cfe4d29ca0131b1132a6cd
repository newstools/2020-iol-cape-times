Cape Town - Police Minister General Bheki Cele will kick-start the #OperationTightGrip Safer Festive Season Operations Inspection Tour in the province tomorrow. The annual roadshow will see Cele, Police Commissioner General Khehla Sitole and top management of the South African Police Service participating in various community awareness engagements and inspections of police festive season operations. With the main aim of the inspection tour being to tighten the grip on crime, especially crimes committed against women and children, the nationwide tour will also see a special focus on compliance and enforcement of the lockdown regulations. Cele will also visit some areas declared Covid-19 hot spots where tighter restrictions have been imposed, including tighter curfews to ensure adherence to Covid-19 regulations and ensure maximum compliance. “Police will be out in full force this holiday season, to tighten the grip on the visible enemy which is crime. However, citizens are also urged to play their part in fighting the invisible enemy and not to drop their guard as Covid-19 is still with us. I'm appealing to all citizens to keep safe this festive season by avoiding super spreader events and large gatherings. Wear your mask at all times and remain vigilant at all times,” Cele said. The #OperationTightGrip Safer Festive Season Operations Inspection tour will kick-off in the Western Cape Thursday and will end in KwaZulu-Natal on December 31. Cape Times
