Cape Town – A sod-turning ceremony of a R33 million housing development project was held in  Delft on Wednesday to benefit 800 people. The Eindhoven housing project comprises a total of 201 Breaking New Ground (BNG) state-subsidised houses and is expected to be completed by the end of June 2021, if all goes according to plan. Cape Town Mayor Dan Plato said the project would provide homes to more than 800 people. “This is a special day for the city, as we celebrate various milestones in Delft. We are also immensely proud of the progress of the existing The Hague project(also in the area).” According to Plato, to date, in the final phase, more than 86 units have been handed to qualifying residents and enabled them to become “first-time” homeowners. “A total of 800 new BNG opportunities are being built at a cost of R130 million. We thank the City’s project teams for their continued hard work in helping the City provide homes to our residents across the metro. “We want to thank the community for working with the City over the next few years to ensure the Eindhoven project becomes a successful reality. ’’It will also be incredibly important that the community at large helps us to prevent the unlawful occupation of this project, and others across the metro,”said Plato. Mayoral committee member for Human Settlements Malusi Booi said the selection of beneficiaries for housing projects was done in accordance with the City’s allocation policy and the housing needs register. “To ensure that housing opportunities are allocated to qualifying beneficiaries in a fair and equitable manner that prevents queue-jumping, the beneficiary target areas are determined in consultation with the community’s representatives, and submitted to a Housing Allocation Committee for approval,” said Booi. Residents can anonymously report unlawful occupation or illegal activity by contacting toll free 112 from a cellphone and 107 from a landline or alternatively 021 480 7700 for emergency. Cape Times
