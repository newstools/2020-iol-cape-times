Cape Town - Transport and Public Works MEC Bonginkosi Madikizela said on Monday he was opposed to suggestions to stop interprovincial traveling between the Eastern Cape and Western Cape during the festive season. Madikizela visited taxi ranks in Bellville, Khayelitsha Site C and the Cape Town station deck, to assess compliance with Covid-19 regulations in public transport. Speaking at the Cape Town taxi rank, Madikizela said the level of noncompliance very high. “If we had leaders in these places that make sure that people comply we would not be having this problem. I mean the level of non-compliance is so high, people are not wearing their masks. We have seen that the cases are increasing particularly in the metro and in the Garden Route. “We have to make sure that in the public transport there is air circulation and these are things that we have to make sure that people continue doing because if we don't, the cases will continue to rise. “I am vehemently opposed to any suggestion that people must not come to Cape Town for holidays and I am opposed to that people might not go to the Eastern Cape to visit their families, but we must make sure that people understand that they need to stick to the regulations to curb the spread.” Provincial government would intensify law enforcement, Madikizela said, adding that the public must understand there would be consequences for violating regulations. “Traffic officers will be on high alert, once the driver is caught not wearing a mask we might take a decision of turning you back, and if you are not wearing a mask as a passenger we will take you out of the public transport,” he said. City transport portfolio committee chairperson Angus McKenzie said: “From the City's side, we will make sure that we assist in enforcing these regulations especially on our public transport interchanges.” Cape Times
