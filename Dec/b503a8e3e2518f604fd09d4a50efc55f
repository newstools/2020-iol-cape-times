Cape Times: A man who works for a company that is contracted by the Department of Basic Education (DBE) to print 2020 matric exam papers has been arrested in connection with the leaked Maths paper 2. Themba Shikwambana, 31, was arrested last Wednesday following a Hawks serious corruption investigation for alleged theft of the Maths exam paper. Hawks spokesperson Colonel Katlego Mogale said Shikwambana made his first appearance in the Johannesburg Magistrate’s Court on Thursday and was remanded. “Shikwambana works for a Johannesburg-based company that is contracted by the Department of Basic Education to print the current year’ Matric exam papers,” said Katlego. The accused appeared again on Monday where he was granted R1 000 bail and his case was postponed to January 27. An investigation into the leakage of other papers was still continuing, said Katlego. Basic Education spokesperson Elijah Mhlanga confirmed the arrest. The department had approached the Hawks to assist in their investigation. This latest development comes as Mhlanga issued a statement that the Council of Education Ministers (CEM) held a special meeting this morning to receive a preliminary report into the leaked matric exam question papers. Initially the preliminary report was scheduled to be received on Monday. “The CEM deliberated on the report and noted that the investigation had not yet been completed and that more work still needed to be done. The council agreed that the credibility, integrity and fairness of the examination cannot be compromised. “CEM acknowledged the complex nature of the investigation; CEM also appreciated the work being done by the Directorate for Priority Crime Investigations, the Hawks to assist the department in the investigation.” Mhlanga said the report would be processed internally and DBE Minister Angie Motshekga is expected to host a media briefing later this week to make an announcement.
