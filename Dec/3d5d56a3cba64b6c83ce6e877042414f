Cape Town - South African police are being lauded over a bust involving drugs worth R300 000. In a statement, Western Cape police spokesman FC van Wyk said the bust was the result of an intelligence driven operation in Khayelitsha on Wednesday. He said members of the South African Police Service attached to the Provincial Integrated Team followed up on information about a suspect allegedly selling mandrax for a leading gang also alleged to be involved in extortion incidents in the area. A search of the premises yielded 2,800 mandrax tablets with an estimated street value of R300 000. “An 18-year-old man was arrested for dealing in drugs. The suspect is due to appear in the Khayelitsha magistrates court,” Van Wyk said. Western Cape commissioner Lieutenant-General Yolisa Matakata commended police for their efforts in the bust and thanked members of the community for reporting criminals. In an unrelated incident,  a 21-year-old woman was arrested in Heinz Park, Samora Machel on Tuesday and faces charges of possession of drugs. Van Wyk said officers were doing visible policing patrols in the Nyanga and Heinz Park areas at the time. Upon receiving information about a house where firearms and drugs were stashed, officers searched the premises and found 110 sachets of methamphetamine (tik), 10 mandrax tablets. They immediately arrested the suspect. “She is due to appear in the Philippi magistrates court once charged,” Van Wyk said. African News Agency (ANA)
