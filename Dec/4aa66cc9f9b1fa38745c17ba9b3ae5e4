Cape Town -Emergency services assisted by Wilderness Search and Rescue (WSAR) teams received three calls for help by noon on Sunday – hours after they retrieved the body of a hiker from Table Mountain’s Skeleton Gorge  on Saturday. In Constantia a fallen mountain biker in Cecilia Forest injured an ankle, while four people got lost on Table Mountain. Another mountain biker also fell on the slopes of the Simonsberg Mountain, close to Helshoogte in Stellenbosch. WSAR has sent its condolences to the family of the hiker on who died on Saturday. The Johannesburg woman is suspected to have fallen. WSAR was alerted just after 10am to the unconscious woman, who was about 200m from the top of Skeleton Gorge. They said two paramedics drove their vehicle to the scene via Constantia Nek, where they were joined by three more vehicles. “By the time the hasty team reached the patient, other persons reported that they had been administering CPR for about an hour. The AMS (Air Mercy Service) helicopter contracted to the Department of Health was also authorised to assist. “A ground crew were deployed to the main entrance of Kirstenbosch Botanical Gardens to assist the helicopter. The paramedics were not able to revive the patient and the body was extracted by the helicopter. Another vehicle, together with the first team, brought the rest of the hiking party down the mountain. We mourn the death of a mountain hiker and extend our condolences to her family and friends,” WSAR said. Cape Times
