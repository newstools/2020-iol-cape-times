Cape Town - The Western Cape Missing Persons Unit (WCMPU) says they have noticed an influx of missing persons, urging families to remain vigilant during this time. The concern comes as police wait for DNA test results to confirm whether the body of a child found in Imizamo Yethu in Hout Bay on Tuesday is that of Anothando Mhlobo who went missing in August. Police spokesperson Novela Potelwa said police were investigating the identity, gender and cause of death following the discovery of the body in a “rocky and sandy area” of Imizamo Yethu. “Due to the state of decomposition of the body, the age, gender and identity could not be immediately determined. “An autopsy is expected to be conducted soon to determine the cause of death. DNA testing will also be done to ascertain if the body is that of Anothando Mhlobo from the area who went missing in August 2020,” said Potelwa. According to a social media post by the local Community Policing Forum, a man was digging for sand when he found the body in an open field. Anothando went missing on August 10 at 1pm and was last seen dressed in a navy blue, red and white jacket, and red and navy blue tracksuit pants and a pair of Spider-Man gumboots, while he was outside his home playing with other children. WCPMU founder Candice van der Rheede said: “We have seen a spike in missing person cases, including both children and adults. Normally the reason for children running away or going missing is due to social issues. Our children are hungry.” Prevention and awareness is of high priority to the organisation, said Van der Rheede, and this was being done by proactive steps taken when children are seen roaming the streets and begging at robots. Van der Rheede has urged families to keep recent pictures in the event that somebody was reported missing and to report a missing person case as soon as possible. chevon.booysen@inl.co.za Cape Times
