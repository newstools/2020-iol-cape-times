Cape Town - The next Cape2Rio Race will run virtually in January between the two iconic cities, the Royal Cape Yacht Club (RCYC) has announced. “Online navigation is a great way to hone your skills, to understand the science of weather routing and the interpretation of data now so readily available via the advent of cloud computing,” the club said. “This very same data is also available in real time to help with any passage planning that you may be doing, making sailing a lot more predictable within reason, from those heady days of 1971 when the first Cape2Rio Race took place.” The race will take place with the help of Sailonline.org , a sailing simulator for routing. The RCYC said registration for the Virtual Cape2Rio Race 2021 will start around six days before the start and updates will be available on its Facebook site. Registration can be done through the link on www.cape2riorace.com “Numerous races are held on this platform throughout the year in a multitude of locations across the globe. We hope that you will join us and have fun competing virtually against family and friends, using this unique tool. We will be racing a state-of-the-art Mark Mills-designed 74-foot yacht optimised for the race conditions, called the C2R74.” Cape Times
