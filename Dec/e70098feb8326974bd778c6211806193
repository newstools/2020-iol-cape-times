Cape Town - Road users have been urged to drive safely this festive season as 29 road fatalities have been recorded in a week. Provincial traffic said 25 crashes happened between December 14 and 21. Provincial traffic spokesperson Jandré Bakker said nine drivers, three passengers, 15 pedestrians and two motorcyclists were killed. She said as holiday traffic was expected to increase, traffic services have urged motorists not to drink and drive and to observe Covid-19 safety protocols at all times. “There has been a steady increase of active cases of Covid-19 in the Western Cape and certain other provinces over the last few weeks. If you are planning to travel over the festive season, wear your mask over your nose and mouth at all times in any public transport vehicle, whether it is a minibus, a bus, a train or an aircraft. Make sure the windows of any minibus, bus or train you travel in are open 5cm on both sides of the vehicle. “Never drink and drive. Even small amounts of alcohol can slow down your response in an emergency,” said Bakker. The City’s traffic services noted an increase in traffic volumes, said mayco member for Safety and Security JP Smith. “The City is aware that traffic volumes have increased following the closure of schools last week and the Day of Reconciliation holiday, which generally signals the end of the working year for many people.” Smith said they were hopeful that the public would abide by lockdown regulations and the 11pm curfew, and pleaded with motorists to be responsible on the road. “The City does want to remind the public that we will be rigorously enforcing the regulations, so anyone caught out after curfew without a valid reason as stated in the disaster management regulations will be fined. To report non-compliance of public transport operators, use the USSD code *134*234# chevon.booysen@inl.co.za Cape Times
