Cape Town â€“ Accused husband murderer Zurenah Smit will remain in custody after her bail application could not be heard yesterday. Smit appeared alongside Karel Sait and Steven Damon in the Stellenbosch Magistrate's Court, where, after a delay in the morning, the court could not hear all the details of the bail application for the trio. The three accused face charges of murder, house robbery, illegal possession of a firearm, illegal possession of ammunition and assault with the intent to do grievous bodily harm. Smit , 54, who had handed herself over to police on Monday, applied for bail after she was remanded in custody following her first court appearance earlier this week. Police had arrested Sait and Damon during the execution of a search warrant in Bellville South, Milnerton and Wynberg on December 10. Smit, who was sought by police as a third suspect as she had evaded arrest, handed herself over to police four days later. Stefan Smit, owner of Stellenbosch wine farm Louisenhof, was murdered in June last year when armed suspects entered their residence through an unlocked door on a Sunday evening. The robbers had made off with two cellphones and a handbag after shooting Stefan multiple times. It is alleged that Sait and Damon were known to Stefan, one being their former bodyguard and the other the bodyguard's brother-in-law. Smit and a guest were unscathed during the apparent attack. She had reportedly become a person of interest in the murder after it came to light she was cut out of Smit's will, which was altered during 2018 when R200 000 was stolen from his safe. Cape Times
