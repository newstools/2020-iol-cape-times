Cape Town - ANC MP Faiez Jacobs said he will “not be silenced” after City of Cape Town Speaker Dirk Smit publicly asked for an explanation from him for alleged statements made on a WhatsApp group. Smit said he was informed of comments posted on a Bonteheuwel Community WhatsApp Group wherein Jacobs was alleged to have said “JP (Smith) must be dealt with!” and that a “Show down (sic) is coming!” Jacobs on Sunday said the DA was insulting to think the party was “only violent”. “When the DA seeks to distort my words and give a violent meaning to what I meant when I said JP Smith must be dealt with, it is trying to create a storm because I’m exposing them and people are beginning to see them for what they are. “The DA and JP Smith must be dealt with because they have failed our people. He must be dealt with because he is arrogant and racist. They must be dealt with because they are causing suffering and division. Let’s expose the hypocrisy. There is a litany of injustices. “The allegations made against me by the DA Speaker of the City of Cape Town, Dirk Smith, about social media remarks I have made about the Mayco Member for Safety and Security, JP Smith, smacks of fake outrage and shameful opportunism,” Jacobs said. Smit had on Friday asked Jacobs to “clarify what he meant”. “I view the safety of all councillors as paramount and any threats or threatening remarks being made in relation to any of our councillors are unacceptable and will not be tolerated,” he said.
