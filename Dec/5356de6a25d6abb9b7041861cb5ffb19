Cape Town - The SA Democratic Teachers’ Union (Sadtu) wants information from a Basic Education Department (DBE) audit to be used to strengthens ecurity relating to the national examination system. This was deliberated by Sadtu’s National Executive Committee (NEC) at the weekend. Sadtu general-secretary Mugwena Maluleke said reports from different provinces showed that the administration of the National Senior Examination was generally well managed except for Mathematics Paper 2 and Physical Science Paper 2 that were leaked hours before they were written last month. Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga confirmed last week that Government Printing Works (GPW) was the source of the leaked physics paper. As a result of this, Motshekga said the department  embarked on a process to ensure that similar incidents involving leaked exam papers did not reoccur. “In terms of ensuring that this does not happen again, the department has started with an audit of the entire value chain from origination of question papers to the delivery of question papers to examination centres,” she said. Maluleke said the NEC  was in support of the audit. “The NEC resolved to engage the DBE to do an audit of the National Senior Certificate examination process so that possible gaps in the security system can be determined. This information must then be used to improve and strengthen security relating to the national examination system. If done properly, future leaks can be prevented.” Maluleke said the NEC also noted Sadtu’s successful challenge against Motshekga in the Pretoria High Court on the rewrite of the leaked papers. “Through the challenge, Sadtu gave a voice to the voiceless learners and parents who were going to be made to suffer for the sins of the few,” said Maluleke. okuhle.hlati@inl.co.za Cape Times
