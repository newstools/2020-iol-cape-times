Cape Town - Decent housing - including the upgrade of current “matchbox”-style and RDP houses, and more vegetable gardens on the Cape Flats - are what residents deserve. These are among the many recommendations to reverse apartheid spatial planning that have been made by the Forum of Cape Flats Civics (FCFC) in their 62-page submission for the City’s Draft Human Settlements Strategy. “Apartheid spatial planning and the level of violent crime is inter-related. When we are designing our areas, we need to learn from the past not to repeat mistakes, not to repeat conditions people are currently living under,” said FCFC chairperson Lester September. “At the moment our spaces mainly consist of in-fill housing, people filling their backyards with shacks for family etc. We are saying use some of the money allocated to build on unused spaces to improve the apartheid matchbox houses by going up one or two levels and freeing the back to create a safe space for children to play,” said September. The City’s Mayco member for Human Settlements, Malusi Booi, said all submissions would be considered. “All submissions are currently with our public participation team, they are consolidating everything. We will consider all submissions, it will go through an internal process which will culminate in a final submission to council for approval. I am hoping we can go to council by May next year,” said Booi. Cape Times
