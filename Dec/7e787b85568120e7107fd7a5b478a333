Cape Town - The City of Cape Town’s enforcement agencies made at least 100 arrests in the last week and issued 51 353 fines as officers had their hands full with a number of incidents. City officers handled incidents from domestic violence complaints to drunk driving and attacks on staff. The City’s enforcement agencies also impounded 19 vehicles and 31 cellphones. “Our staff have had a busy few days, catching suspects involved in criminal activity but also coming to the aid of residents in need. While it may be the season of good tidings and peace, our city has seen conflict in a number of areas, including flare ups in gang violence with fatal consequences,” said Mayco Member for Safety and Security, JP Smith. Among the incidents recorded were: There were also several incidents of attacks on City staff during the period. At Harmony Park, a taxi driver was arrested on Christmas Day for assaulting a Law Enforcement officer. The suspect became violent when the officer approached him about consuming alcohol in a public space. Just before 8pm on Boxing Day, firefighters responding to motor vehicles alight in Ocean View had to take cover as shots rang out while they were attending to the incident. In Simon’s Town, a traffic officer narrowly missed being hit by a motorcyclist who was trying to evade capture. Smith added that they have also experienced some respite on the beaches, where attendance was much lower compared to what the City was accustomed to. “Even our alcohol confiscation statistics were much lower as a result of the lower numbers, but also restricted alcohol trade.” Cape Argus
