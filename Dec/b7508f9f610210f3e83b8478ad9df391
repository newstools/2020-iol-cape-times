Cape Town – George Municipality manager Trevor Botha has cited “relentless political attacks and vexatious, frivolous and baseless allegations and investigations” as the reason behind his resignation. However, the municipality said Botha and director of Community Services Walter Hendricks, who also resigned “with immediate effect” this week, were facing a disciplinary hearing. Speaking to the Cape Times, Botha said there was a timeline of baseless investigations and attacks against his name. On his future, Botha said he would venture into politics at a later stage but will “certainly avoid like the plague any racist, colonialist and ex-apartheid conspirator political parties”. Hendricks did not respond to questions. In a statement on Wednesday, George mayor Leon van Wyk said findings of the disciplinary report from an SNG Grant Thornton final report on a forensic investigation into allegations of maladministration, fraud and corruption at the George Municipality in respect of the War-on-Waste Project “indicate” that disciplinary steps must be instituted against Botha as accounting officer, Hendricks and a number of other officials. “Following the termination of their contracts, disciplinary steps will therefore not continue against Botha and Hendricks. “It is also commonly known that Botha and Hendricks were summoned to appear in the criminal court for allegations that relate to the War-on-Waste investigations. “It also should be noted that Messrs Botha and Hendricks are currently implicated in two other investigations relating to the Section 106 intervention by the MEC for local government. ’’These investigations have also been referred for disciplinary investigation,” he said.
