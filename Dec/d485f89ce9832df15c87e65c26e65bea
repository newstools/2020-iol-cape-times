Among those is the news that the Western Cape Health Department has restricted in-hospital visits. Non-urgent outpatient appointments will be postponed and patients given alternative dates. Patients who are in hospital but stable will be discharged for further management at home or at a step-down facility, and non-urgent elective surgery will be postponed and patients provided with a later date. Outreaches from district and regional hospitals will also be suspended. The Health Department has also urged patients to only access emergency centres for listed emergencies, and that patients with non-emergencies should access health-care services at the nearest clinic.

Coronavirus spreads where people gather, including at public health facilities. Always wear a clean cloth mask over your mouth and nose, and keep a distance of 1.5m from other people,” the department said. Stay safe tips: Cape Argus
