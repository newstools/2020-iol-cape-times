Cape Town – The man accused of being involved in a mass shooting that claimed the lives of five people in Joe Slovo, Milnerton, has maintained his innocence. Thulani Mabija, 26, is among the six accused of the murders, and was arrested last month after handing himself over to the police. National Prosecuting Authority spokesperson Eric Ntabazalila said Mabija has been charged with five counts of murder. “Thulani Mabija appeared at the Cape Town Magistrate’s Court. He is charged with five counts of murder which took place in Joe Slovo. “His case was postponed to November 24, 2020 for a bail application,” said Ntabazalila. Mabija’s lawyer, Bern Rautenbach, said his client was innocent. “We started the bail application (yesterday) morning with the applicant. The matter was postponed to November 24 2020 for them (the State) to reply to the affidavit. “Rautenbach said he was contacted by Mabija who told him there was a rumour in Joe Slovo that he was among the men accused of the shooting. Rautenbach was instructed to find out more information, and said he later advised his client to hand himself over to the police station. “My client is maintaining he is innocent.” Friends and family of victim Phumla Hlongwane attended proceedings and said they were calling for justice. Hlongwane’s friend, Thembi Manamela, said the alleged perpetrator should not be granted bail. “Every time I come here in court, I am always reminded of my friend and I get very emotional. “The suspect is not the kind of a person that can live in the community. We want justice to play its role,” said Manamela. A spate of mass shootings has recently rocked a number of areas in the City, including Gugulethu, Nyanga, and Khayelitsha. Cape Times
