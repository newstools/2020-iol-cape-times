Cape Town - Embattled TV presenter Katlego Maboe is due to appear in court on Tuesday for allegedly breaching a protection order his ex-partner, Monique Muller, had taken out against him. National Prosecuting Authority spokesperson Eric Ntabazalila confirmed that both Maboe and Muller were expected to appear at the Cape Town Magistrates’ Court. According to a report in the Rapport newspaper on Sunday, Maboe allegedly contravened the stipulations of a protection order Muller had obtained in Sea Point on September 3. Maboe has been caught in a whirlwind after a video went viral, in which Muller  accused him of giving her an STD, and he admits to having an affair with Nikita Murray, a former Outsurance employee. Maboe said it was filmed on August 24 and started as a regular evening at home and ended in the grilling session. “My child was used as a weapon, and as a father, I was placed in a position where I need to consider my love for him ... I said what I said on the video and I tried my best to at least draw the line of the integrity of the people involved. “I was very willing to have the conversation with her in person, but very soon realised the intention of the video from the beginning was for it to be released.” Muller has also gone public with accusations that he had physically abused her during their relationship. Maboe, who has been dropped by the Expresso Morning Show and Outsurance in the wake of the scandal, has denied abusing Muller. The star, who has a child with Muller, has also declined to comment on the court case. Daily Voice
