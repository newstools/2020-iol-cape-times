Cape Town – The provincial Department of Transport and Public Works has urged road users, including pedestrians, to play their role in improving road safety for all. The department said on Wednesday a high percentage of pedestrians killed on the road recently who were tested for alcohol had a blood alcohol content (BAC) of more than 0.2 g per 100ml of blood, which is four times the legal limit for drivers. Male pedestrian fatalities are more likely to have a high BAC than females, they said, with young males being in the category of pedestrians most likely to die after drinking, with the highest risk being for those aged 20 to 29. Department spokesperson Jandré Bakker said their Safely Home campaign encourages motorists to be vigilant on the road, and pedestrians to make themselves visible to motorists, especially at night and in the early morning. She said more than three times as many pedestrians die on Saturdays than on Wednesdays. “If you are a pedestrian, stay away from freeways and busy roads, especially at night, and especially after consuming alcohol. ’’Always wear high visibility clothing, particularly in the evening and in bad weather. Walk-in groups when possible. If you are a motorist, show consideration for pedestrians wherever they are. “Pedestrians are almost always killed in collisions with vehicles travelling more than 60km per hour. Slowing down will give you more time to avoid pedestrians in the road. ’’If you are travelling more slowly and you collide with a pedestrian, the pedestrian is more likely to survive,” said Bakker.
