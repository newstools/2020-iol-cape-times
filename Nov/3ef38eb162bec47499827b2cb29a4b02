Cape Town - Table Mountain National Park (TMNP) anti-crime and poaching operations have led to the arrests of 13 suspected poachers in the past week, SANParks confirmed on Tuesday. TMNP manager Frans van Rooyen said the first group of five poachers were arrested on Thursday in the Kommetjie area following a joint operation between rangers  assisted by the City’s  law enforcement officers. Thirteen units of abandoned abalone (amount undisclosed), and 10 West Coast rock lobster, along with diving gear, was confiscated during the operation. On Friday, three suspects were arrested in the Hout Bay as a result of a joint crime prevention operation between the  SAPS sea border and diving unit, and the SANParks Environment Crime Investigation (ECI) unit. The suspects were found in possession of 86 abalone worth an undisclosed amount, and diving gear which was confiscated. Rangers from the TMNP and the ECI apprehended five poachers in possession of 38 units of abalone following another joint operation patrol along Platboom, north of the Cape of Good Hope road, on Saturday. “We urge our surrounding communities to continue helping us in a fight to curb crime within and around Table Mountain National Park. Congratulations to the entire SANParks team and stakeholders. We thank you for your dedication, obedience and tenacity and we wish you a successful festive season ahead,” Van Rooyen. The suspects have been handed over to the SAPS for further investigation. Cape Times
