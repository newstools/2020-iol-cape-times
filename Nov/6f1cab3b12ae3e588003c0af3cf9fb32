Cape Town - The Red Cross War Memorial Children’s Hospital recently received 40 board game bed sheets to help keep their young patients entertained during hospital stays, thanks to the Fair Cape Cares Foundation in collaboration with Whitehouse, Continental Linen and Woodheads. The sheets feature games including wild cat checkers, hippo tic tac toe, “lemurs and ladders” and animal chess. Children's Hospital Trust  donor relationship manager Taryn Rubenstein said the trust was “incredibly grateful for the generous donation”, adding that it would make such a positive difference to the hospital stays of so many children, who often have nothing with which to pass the time. Fair Cape Cares Foundation trustee Joel Serman said Fair Cape was immensely proud to have been involved in the creation and production of the sheets. “These sheets were made in the true spirit of ubuntu, with the hope that they will make a difference to the children who often have to endure long, tedious stays in the hospital. We wholeheartedly thank our partners for their phenomenal contribution to this worthy project. “Importantly, we would also like to extend an invitation to all corporates in South Africa to contribute towards the production of additional bed sheets to be rolled out to paediatric wards across the country,” Serman said. Whitehouse and Continental Linen marketing director Loren Young  said that as a local linen manufacturer, this gave their company the opportunity to bring joy and entertainment to children during their stay in hospital. “Based on an International concept, we believe this to be the first project of its type to be rolled out in South Africa,” she said.
