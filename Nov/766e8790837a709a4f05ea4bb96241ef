Cape Town – Nine families have been left destitute when their homes burnt down after being petrol bombed in an alleged gang-related incident. Families in Wicht Court, Lavender Hill, said they had lost everything in a fire that started at about 2am yesterday. Single mom-of-three Crystal Paulse said their possessions, including her 5-month-old infant’s medication, was gone. “When I woke up I called my brother Ibrahim,” an emotional Paulse said. “When he tried to open the windows from the backyard, the fire (spread) inside and already there were high flames. ’’I immediately grabbed my children and took them outside. I left everything in the house because I was thinking about nothing but my children’s lives. “I have lost everything including my clothes, cellphones and ID book. I am left with only sleeping clothes. My children have also lost everything including their school uniforms and clothes. ’’We don’t even have a place to sleep; we have no idea where to go. We are left stranded and destitute,” said Paulse. Her 5-month-old child suffers from Atrial septal defect, a birth defect that causes a hole in the wall between the heart’s upper chambers and Paulse said she was especially worried about shelter for the infant. Abdulatief Peterson, 63, who runs a feeding scheme in the community, said his two cars were also destroyed. “Someone came into the house to say it was on fire and I came out and could see that the whole place was burning. Two minutes (later) I could not stand. I became dizzy and it was just smoke all over the place and I could not breathe. “I am glad that my children have been saved and they are alive. I will now have to start from scratch to apply for a feeding scheme because I have lost everything including the papers I had,” said Peterson. Police spokesperson Andrè Traut said Steenberg police responded to a fire in Wicht Court, Lavender Hill. “The cause of the fire is unknown at this stage,” he said. Cape Times
