Cape Town – The man charged with discharging a firearm in public when a group of parents attacked EFF protesters outside the Brackenfell High School has been released on a warning, the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) confirmed on Wednesday. Jaco Pretorius appeared at the Kuils River Magistrate’s Court following his arrest on Monday. NPA spokesperson Eric Ntabazalila said Pretorius's case has been postponed to January 25 for further investigation. Tension ran high when EFF protesters were attacked for demanding the suspension of the two teachers who attended the “whites only” matric ball. The school has been under the spotlight since it emerged that some black pupils were allegedly not invited to attend a matric ball outside the school organised by parents. The school has distanced itself from the event and this week turned to the Western Cape High Court for an urgent interdict against the protests. While the matter has been postponed to Monday, the Ahmed Kathrada Foundation joined the growing voices in condemning  the violence meted out against the EFF supporters, saying: “Those opposing the EFF’s right to gather and protest at the school seemingly did so on the basis that the EFF had no right to be in ’their’ area. This mentality is one that must also be condemned.” The foundation called for an independent probe into the alleged segregated matric ball. “The dismissive attitude of the Western Cape Education Department indicates a serious lack of understanding of the gravity of this issue.” Cape Times
