Cape Town - The University of Western Cape’s Department of Restorative Dentistry Professor Saadika Khan has been elected president of the South African Division of the International Association of Dental Research (IADR). The South African division of the IADR, which has representation from four dental faculties, including UWC, the University of Pretoria, WITS and Sefako Makgatho Health Sciences, as well as UKZN, forms part of the African Middle Eastern Region (AMER group). “With so many women on the committee, this is a real example of female academic power. We are excited to take on the challenge,” Khan said. This year’s IADR-SA conference, held on November 12 and 13, was entirely virtual and participants were still able to share their research and take part in the annual competitions. UWC students Nabeelah Vally and Ammaarah Taliep, who represented their group project, won the Undergraduate Colgate Competition. Their research formed part of their Research Methods module in the fourth year and was supervised by Khan. Dr Nada Nurein won the Postgraduate Colgate competition. Her research was completed toward a Masters in Oral Medicine and Periodontology and was supervised by Dr Holmes and Ernst Maboza. These students automatically qualify to enter the Hatton Competition at the IADR General Session to be held in Boston, US, in July 2021. UWC’s Faculty of Dentistry will host the 2021 IADR-SA conference, and Khan hopes it will attract even more participants interested in sharing research, information and knowledge. Cape Times
