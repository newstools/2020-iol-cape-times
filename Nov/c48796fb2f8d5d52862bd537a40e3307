Cape Town – The SANDF has applauded military police for arresting a shop owner who was illegally selling military uniforms. In a statement, the SANDF said Johannesburg military police arrested a shop owner who was illegally selling various garments, ranging from shirts, trousers and short pants, using military camouflage material. “The shop owner… was arrested in one of his shops at Voortrekker Road in Vereeniging on Tuesday following a complaint laid by the SANDF  member to the military police," the SANDF said. The man appeared before the Vereeniging Magistrate’s Court on Wednesday and was released pending the investigation that is currently underway. “The SANDF has on a number of occasions expressed concerns about the unabated illegal use of military combat dress and come out strongly with a warning to civilians wearing uniform, especially camouflage solely for the use by authorised members of the SANDF or members identified by the chief of the SANDF and appointed honorary members of various military units," the SANDF said. It reiterated that any person who is illegally wearing the SANDF camouflage and not a member, and not authorised to use the patented camouflage, is guilty of an offence in terms of the Defence Act. If found guilty, a fine or imprisonment for a period not exceeding five years can be imposed. Cape Times
