Cape Town - The Department of Basic Education expressed disappointment following a leak of the Grade 12 Mathematics Paper 2 on Monday. Department spokesperson Elijah Mhlanga said initial indications are that the paper became available early in the morning, hours before it was written. Mhlanga said the origins of the leak were not clear yet but the matric candidates who had access to the question paper appeared to be located in the Limpopo and Gauteng provinces. “The Department verified the content of the question paper and found it to be the same as the question paper that was to be written at 9am. “The Department of Basic Education is investigating the matter to establish the extent of the leak. Early sources point to the confinement of the leakage to a few learners located in these two provinces,” said Mhlanga. He said an investigating team is gathering evidence and a report will be submitted. The Department will enlist the support of the Law Enforcement agencies to assist with the investigation. “The Department will investigate this matter fully and thoroughly and will utilize the mechanisms it has at its disposal which are part of the examination protocol to identify learners that may have had access to the paper,” said Mhlanga. The department urged all candidates to remain focused on the exam papers that are still to be written. It said the culprits responsible for the “despicable act” would be dealt with harshly. Cape Times
