Cape Town - E-hailing service Bolt has introduced an emergency response button for passengers in response to growing safety concerns. The SOS button, located within Bolt’s app’s Safety Toolkit, enables passengers to connect quickly and easily 24/7 to private armed response teams, private emergency medical services, and roadside assistance if they are involved in any medical or security emergency while on a Bolt ride. The new safety feature is at no cost to passengers and is enabled through an expansion of Bolt’s partnership with national safety platform Namola. “If a Bolt passenger feels unsafe or if they are involved in an accident or any other emergency incident while on a ride, they can activate the Namola-linked SOS button in the Safety Toolkit on their Bolt app,” said country manager for Bolt in South Africa, Gareth Taylor. Namola guarantees a call-back within 90 seconds, they establish the nature of the incident, send the appropriate response services to the passenger’s location immediately, and help passengers stay calm and safe while they wait for assistance to arrive. On November 10, a 20-year-old was arrested for armed robbery and possession of a hijacked vehicle. He was also found in possession of three different cell phones and a vehicle. During questioning it was discovered that one cell phone belonged to an e-hailing driver whom he and his accomplices allegedly robbed in Browns Farm. The integration between Bolt and Namola’s technology platforms makes it possible for the emergency response teams to ascertain passenger’s identity, location and contact information, the make, model and licence plate of the car, as well as their driver’s details. “Safety is an ongoing focus for everyone in the transportation sector in South Africa and it’s our responsibility to continue to invest heavily in keeping our passengers and drivers safe while they are utilising our platform,” Taylor said.
