Cape Town – A journalist from StellenboschNews.com is in hot water for allegedly attacking a DA councillor at a meeting in the Stellenbosch Municipality’s Town Hall yesterday. The DA said councillor Patricia Crawley had refused to comment when this “infuriated the journalist to a point where he assaulted her”. The alleged incident happened in full view of other councillors, law enforcement and municipal officials following yesterday’s urgent council meeting in the Stellenbosch Town Hall. Stellenbosch councillor Wilhelmina Petersen said: “After several attempts by onlookers to calm the situation, the journalist continued hounding the councillor. Suffering from severe shock, the councillor received medical attention from paramedics after the altercation.” She said the municipality condemned the incident and attacks on their female councillors. “Charges of assault and intimidation will be laid with the SAPS. Witnesses to this incident will also be preparing witness statements. “We will also be contacting the Press Ombudsman to formally lay a complaint against the journalist. “It is truly shocking that such an assault on a female councillor took place, especially as this is the month in which South Africans observe 16 Days of Activism against violence against women and children. “The municipality stands firmly opposed to any form of gender-based violence and denounces the despicable actions of this journalist,” Petersen said. StellenboschNews.com editor Danie Keet said one of their journalists asked a councillor about a criminal charge she had instituted against a fellow councillor for an ongoing story. “Referring to the incident as an ‘attack’ is unnecessary, but we condemn any form of violent confrontation,” Keet said. Police spokesperson Colonel Andrè Traut said police were investigating a case of assault. Cape Times
