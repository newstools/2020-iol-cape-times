Staff Writer Cape Town – An off-duty police officer is among seven people suspected of planning to commit business robberies in the Western Cape, police said on Thursday. Bellville SAPS officers reacted to a tip-off and conducted a “clandestine” operation which led to suspects being arrested for the possession of two prohibited firearms, said Western Cape police spokesperson Colonel Andre Traut. “Information received from an anonymous source indicated that five suspects were due to arrive in Bellville on a long-distance bus from KwaZulu-Natal with the intention to commit business robberies. ’’The bus stop was placed under observation and the arrival of the suspects was monitored,” said Traut. The five suspects were collected by two suspects in two separate vehicles – a Toyota and a Kia. “With their departure, both vehicles were stopped and searched, which led to the discovery of the two firearms without serial numbers. ’’One of the suspects driving the Kia was identified as an off-duty police constable stationed at Ravensmead police station,” he said. Traut said an internal disciplinary process will be initiated immediately in relation to the arrested police member. Western Cape police commissioner Lieutenant-General Yolisa Matakata commended her officers for bringing the suspects to book, thereby preventing violent armed robberies from occurring and vowed that that there was no place in the SAPS for police officials who commit crime.
