Cape Town – The City has confirmed the return of much-loved baboon Kataza to his natal Slangkop troop home on Thursday. He was captured in the Tokai area in the morning after detailed monitoring of the situation by the City. The City said all forms of artificial identification were removed, and he was assessed by a veterinarian before his release in his natal Slangkop troop home range soon after. This after residents and animal lovers piled pressure on the City to return him to his troop. Kataza was controversially relocated to join the Zwaanswyk troop in Tokai on August 26 after he was said to have begun to inbreed, causing the troop to splinter and so compromising the welfare of all members. The City said: “The SPCA’s senior inspector and veterinarian were on site and monitored the capture and release. The City can confirm that he was found to be fit and healthy prior to his release. ’’As stated before, upon his release, SK11 (Kataza’s) previous raiding record will not be considered in future decisions. This is in an effort to give him a fair chance to adjust to his natal home range, namely the surrounding mountains in the Kommetjie area.” The City has requested the public to not follow Kataza now that he has been released, and to allow him space and time within his Slangkop troop home range.
