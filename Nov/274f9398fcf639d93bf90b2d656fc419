Cape Town – The Uniondale NGO accused of defrauding the Department of Employment and Labour (DOL) of millions in Covid-19 Temporary Employer/ Employee Relief Scheme (Ters) funds has refuted the claims. “It is with deep regret that we have been confronted with a very defamatory statement from the Department of Labour. “Many of the issues raised were tenuous and pre-emptive,” the Uniondale Integrated Empowerment Project (UNIEP) said in a statement. The department said they had received and responded to a complaint about an employer in Uniondale, a small agricultural town approximately 120 kilometres from George, who claimed for Ters funds on behalf of 520 employees even though their contract of employment was terminated on March 25. “A total amount of R4 771 837.83 was paid out to the employer in Ters monies. “The department is awaiting proof that the employer paid it over to the employees as the employees at the time could not confirm all the amounts,” the department said in its statement. UNIEP said they had interacted with the department, invalidating the claims. “It is our firm conviction that after various interactions with representatives from the department, they have still deemed it appropriate to insinuate legal and procedural breaches that UNIEP is allegedly guilty of without even considering many of the submission made to Department of Labour (DOL), invalidating the negative assertions made in the media release.” The organisation said they would take legal action.
