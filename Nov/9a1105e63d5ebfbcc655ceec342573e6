Cape Town – A stolen husky has been reunited with his owner after more than a year. Storm was picked up by Cape of Good Hope SPCA collections officers in Zeekoevlei and was positively identified thanks to his microchip. “We scan all animals that come to us for microchip identification, which is how we discovered Storm. Without the microchip or collar, ideally both, it becomes very difficult to identify ownership, track and trace lost and found animals back to their owners,” the SPCA’s Keagan Wolfaart said. The SPCA tried to contact Storm’s owner, Damian Leeuw, of Pelican Park, on Monday. He was not home at the time. His partner answered and was beside herself with excitement. “I literally just walked into the house when Taryn said: Do you want to hear the good news? What good news? The SPCA found Storm, you need to go collect him. Wait, what? I grabbed my ID, quickly took out the baby seat, got in the car and left immediately. When I got the news, I was completely blown away,” Leeuw said. “I feel so relieved. It was so remarkable to have him back and also to see his reaction when I got to the kennels. I thought he would behave evasively or not remember me, but he came towards me, sniffed me and immediately started whining. I knew then that Storm knows exactly who I am … We are going to be okay.” Leeuw said Storm was chipped at 3 months. On the day he went missing, he said his neighbours witnessed people taking Storm, putting him into a car and driving off. “I was broken, there was nothing I could do. I drove around looking for Storm. I started spending more time with my pitbull, Tyson. He and Storm grew up together and he also started showing signs of being lonely, obviously missing Storm,” said Leeuw. The SPCA advised pet owners to have their pets microchipped and ensure details are up to date. Cape Times
