Cape Town – Opposition parties were out in full force on Wednesday in an aim to win the vacant wards in what has been called the country's largest by-elections. Voting stations opened as early as 7am in wards across the Western Cape. The by-elections are taking place under strict Covid-19 protocols to ensure the safety of voters, election staff, party agents, observers and other stakeholders. Chief electoral officer Sy Mamabolo said the reduction in the alert level and lifting of restrictions on political activities provided a window to the Independent Electoral Commission to clear the backlog of by-elections ahead of next year’s municipal elections. “Ward council vacancies are not ordinarily filled during the final six months leading to municipal elections. South Africa will continue to hold by-elections for all the wards that become vacant until May 2021. ’’However, holding all outstanding by-elections together on one day will help the Electoral Commission and political parties to focus their attention and energies on one day and to clear the backlog in one go,” he said. ANC national spokesperson Pule Mabe said they perceived local government as a doorstep to democracy. “The ANC calls on all its members and supporters, as well as all those eligible, to go and exercise their democratic right by choosing local councillors who will best advance the delivery of basic services in local communities,” Mabe said. DA federal chairperson Dr Ivan Meyer said on Tuesday: “Our country is deeply wounded, especially as a result of the Covid pandemic, and now is the time to start recovering. The DA is the only party that is big enough and has a proven track record in good and clean service delivery.” Good secretary-general Brett Herron said: “We are in it to win it now, and to lay the seeds to assume leadership of municipalities after the local government elections next year.” Cape Times
