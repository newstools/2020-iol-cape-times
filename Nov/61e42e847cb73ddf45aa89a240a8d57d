Cape Town – The murder case of the man accused of killing 22-year-old Nomvuzo Atoli has been moved to next year. Sive Mpafa, 29, made a brief appearance at the Athlone Magistrate’s Court on Tuesday morning, where the case was postponed for further investigation. He has been charged with Atoli’s murder after her body was discovered in August, dumped at a landfill site in Philippi. At Mpafa’s previous appearance, the court heard he had followed her from where she had been hanging out with her friends in the Siyanyanzela informal settlement. He abandoned his bail application after he reportedly confessed to having murdered Atoli by repeatedly hitting her head with a brick. Mpafa was nabbed in Idutywa in the Eastern Cape after fleeing Cape Town. Atoli’s aunt, the 59-year-old Zandile Atoli, said they were grateful for the support they continue to receive from the community and organisations during their journey to healing. “We can never get through this on our own so the support we are still receiving to date means a lot to us. The family is looking forward to the day we stop seeing the suspect and we hope he will never get out of prison again. ’’We are aware he had recently been released from jail on another murder charge.” Advocacy group Ilitha Labantu spokesperson Siyabulela Monakali said: “The family wants the case to run swiftly and unfortunately the longer it drags on the longer it affects them as they have to face the perpetrator. ’’We will continue to support the family until we see justice is served. As a Children and Women’s Rights organisation, we will also put pressure on the justice system to treat the case with the urgency it deserves.” Mpafa is expected back in court on January 12.
