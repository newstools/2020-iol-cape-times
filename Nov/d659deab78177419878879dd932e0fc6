Cape Town – SANParks opens its doors for free entry to national parks this week for anyone with a valid SA ID. SANParks, with Minister of Environment, Forestry and Fisheries, Barbara Creecy, launched the 15th annual SANParks Week at the West Coast National Park. The feature element of this campaign is free access granted to all South African day visitors from November 16-20. SANParks chief executive, Fundisile Mketeni, said the central objective of the week was to cultivate a culture of pride in its national parks. "We remain acutely aware of the history of this country and the marginalisation of a majority of South Africans that is associated with our painful past and through these initiatives we want to make our small contribution towards addressing past imbalances. "We also see the National Parks week as another opportunity to showcase all national parks as key and affordable local holiday destinations which offer a unique and enlightening experience that families and individuals from all backgrounds, cultures, lifestyles and communities can enjoy," said Mketeni. As an added bonus, parks in the Cape Region – Agulhas, Bontebok, Table Mountain, Tankwa Karoo and West Coast National Park – will be extending South African National Parks Week until November 22. The campaign will allow locals with valid identity documents an opportunity to spend a day at a national park of their choice. The week-long campaign will be applicable to all the national parks managed by SANParks, with the exception of Boulders Penguin Colony and the Table Mountain Aerial Cableway in Table Mountain National Park, and Namaqua National Park.
