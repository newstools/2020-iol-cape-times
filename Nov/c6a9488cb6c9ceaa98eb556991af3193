Cape Town - The Western Cape Government has issued an urgent hotspot alert for the Garden Route due to a rapidly increasing number of Covid-19 cases. “This spike is mainly contributing to the notable growth of active cases in the Western Cape,” the provincial government said in a statement. “Specifically, we are concerned about the increasing number of cases in George, Knysna and Bitou. George, which currently has 628 active cases, has the highest number of active cases in the province.” Over the weekend, 160 new Covid-19 cases were recorded in George, 145 new cases in Knysna/Bitou, 41 new cases in Mossel Bay, and seven new cases in Hessequa. Along with the increasing number of cases in the region, the number of hospitalisations is also increasing. “Our hospitals still have sufficient capacity to cope with the surge in cases, however, we must all be taking responsibility to ensure that we are able to contain the further spread of the virus.” The hotspot team for the Garden Route has increased surveillance, through screening and testing. “We are also working closely with the municipalities, environmental health teams, and stakeholders in the region to manage and contain the spread. This includes a concerted communications campaign in the area. We are also paying special attention to vulnerable groups, including old age homes," the province said. Those feeling sick have been advised to stay at home and those experiencing symptoms to call the hotline on 080 928 4102 for assistance. Cape Times
