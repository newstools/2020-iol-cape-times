RAMAPHOSA TO GIVE LOCKDOWN UPDATE President Cyril Ramaphosa is expected to update the nation on the government’s risk adjusted strategy to manage the spread of the virus this week. Speculation is rife that the president is preparing to lift the state of disaster, ending the lockdown which started on March 27, ruining the economy but possibly saving thousands of lives. VACCINE UPDATE On Monday, Pfizer Inc and BioNTech said initial trial results have shown their coronavirus vaccine to be more than 90 percent effective at preventing Covid-19, based on data from the first 94 people in the trial to be infected with the coronavirus. The overwhelming majority of infections occurred among people who received a placebo rather than the vaccine. Scientists have welcomed the news but say that many questions remain unanswered.
