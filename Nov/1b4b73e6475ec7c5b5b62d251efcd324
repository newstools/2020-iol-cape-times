Cape Town – With Table View beach labelled a drowning hotspot during summer holidays, safety efforts received a boost through the launch of a drowning prevention operational hub. The custom-built hub, a joint initiative between the City’s Recreation and Parks Department and the National Sea Rescue Institute (NSRI), was officially launched on Friday. Mayco member for community services and health Zahid Badroodien said the beach has become a drowning hotspot. Of the 16 drownings recorded in Cape Town between September 2019 and March 2020, Table View’s coastline accounted for 25% of incidents, Badroodien said. Most incidents were related to strong rip currents, which are prevalent along the two kilometre stretch of the coast. The NSRI provided the branded mobile unit that provides shelter, storage space and the ideal vantage point for observing activities along the coastline. Lifeguards will deploy from the hub adequately equipped to patrol the beachfront and activate further emergency services should the need arise. Badroodien said the City had allocated eight seasonal and one senior seasonal lifeguard to the Table View beachfront. They will be on the beach daily from 10am until 6pm. “Important to note however, lifeguards will not set up a swimming area, as the prevalent rip currents do not allow for safe swimming. “Lifeguards will be on site to assist in emergencies and primarily as a preventative measure, constantly engaging members of the public to educate them about the dangerous swimming conditions and encouraging them to make use of the nearest safe swimming areas at Big Bay or Milnerton,” said Badroodien. NSRI’s lifeguard operations manager Stewart Seini said the NSRI was committed to providing drowning prevention initiatives and proactive lifeguarding where most needed. “We believe in working better together, so naturally working together with the City to put lifeguards on this stretch of beach is important for our vision of 'zero drownings’.” Cape Times
