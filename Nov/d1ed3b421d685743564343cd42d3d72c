Cape Town – As President Cyril Ramaphosa is this week expected to address the nation over further managing the spread of Covid-19, most sub-districts in Cape Town are seeing a decrease or flattening of cases, except in Khayelitsha, which has recorded a small increase. This is according to the provincial Health Department which recently said over the past few weeks the number of new positive cases had fluctuated, having dropped to below 20% last week. According to the province’s dashboard yesterday, there were 3 169 currently infected patients; 109 975 recoveries, and 4 393 deaths. Nationally there are around 37 379 active cases and there have been 19 789 deaths. The country’s recovery rate stands at 92%. The department said the increase in Khayelitsha was off a “very small base” and therefore not a cause for concern yet. “A similar scenario is being experienced in the rural areas, with some areas in George (Thembalethu, Pacaltsdorp and Uniondale) having seen a small increase in cases. “Similarly, in Bitou (Knysna), there have been small increases (19 new cases), but through our surveillance strategy it has been established that the increase is the result of local travellers who returned to Bitou and subsequently tested positive.” The department said the hospitalisation and mortality data remained stable. “(A total of) 20 000 tests are conducted per week with below 10% positivity rate. “Waste-water surveillance is now part of our surveillance strategy, which is being conducted at 10 waste-water plants. ’’In the previous week this testing strategy indicated a sharp increase in cases, but this week there has been a reduction in the waste-water testing,” the department said.
