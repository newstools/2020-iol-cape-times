Cape Town – Family, friends and community members bid an emotional farewell to 25-year-old Miché Pienaar of Wolseley, whose body was discovered in a shallow grave in Pine Valley informal settlement. Pienaar’s body was identified last Monday along with that of 21-year-old Bernadine Frans, who was also buried in a shallow grave, a month after her mother, Francis, reported her missing. Siyamnkela Sobambela, 32, has been arrested for the crimes and has since been charged with three counts of murder. The last time Francis, 65, communicated with her daughter was in September. Her mother said the family was happy that they found Pienaar’s body and could bury her on Saturday. “The family was very sad, but now they are okay, they are happy that we found her and buried her like a human being, not like an animal. We buried her. The detectives are busy with the case, and by December 9, we will be in court. “Her son is fine, he looked at the photos and he said, ‘Bye Miché, bye’. I will miss her,” the mother said. National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) spokesperson Eric Ntabazalila said last week more charges were likely to be added as the investigation continued. Sobambela remains in custody. Community leader Jacob Zalie said the community came out in their numbers to support the family. “I am very disappointed that there was no local leadership, no councillor who came to support. It is poor people, two families – two weeks after each other. They really suffered to bury their children. “I got local private sponsors to help them but there was nothing from the local or provincial government,” he said. Witzenberg councillor Patric Daniels was not available for comment by deadline. Cape Times
