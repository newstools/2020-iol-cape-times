Cape Town – After applying for Unemployment Insurance Fund in June, a Steenberg pensioner said she was at her wits’ end as she struggled to receive the payment despite numerous visits to Department of Labour offices. The woman, who asked to remain anonymous, said visiting the Cape Town office was a nightmare as snaking queues halted early in the afternoon, signalling “another day wasted”. “It is completely unacceptable. People come early in the morning to queue in those lines in the hope of being attended to on that day but more often than not they leave disappointed because they get no help. ’’What makes it worse is that there is no communication all day while you queue outside for about five, or in some cases, up to nine hours,” she said. The pensioner, who retired earlier this year, said she wasted many days in a queue with no assistance. The woman said she tried the online application process but it resulted in a negative experience. “When you follow all prompts and get passwords, the system kicks us out. I have tried it numerous times but that also does not work which is why I had returned to the offices physically to get answers,” she said. Department of Labour spokesperson Candice van Reenen said a backlog was being experienced due to a brief temporary halt with Covid19-Ters (Temporary Employer/Employee Scheme) funds and turnaround times on claims are taking longer than previously experienced. “This backlog is being addressed. However, it is important to note that claims are being attended to according to date order, with older claims receiving priority first,” said Van Reenen. Van Reenen said queue marshalling is mandatory at labour centres. “Presently, staff move through the queues to categorise clients and also regularly communicate with them throughout the day.” Those who require assistance with the online service can contact 0800 030 007.
