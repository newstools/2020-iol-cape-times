Cape Town - The Department of Social Development (DSD) has expressed concern over Covid-19 infections that are increasing in old age homes across the Western Cape, with 20 active cases currently reported. According to the provincial department, as at Wednesday a total of 1 695 older persons have recovered from the virus. Current figures also show an increase of 13 infections since the DSD last provided an update on October 14 2020. Social Development MEC Sharna Fernandez said while the number of recoveries was encouraging they will continue to monitor strict health and safety protocols. “We are continuing to work closely with all old age homes in the province, however, we also require family members, stakeholders and citizens, who are visiting their loved ones to follow the Covid-19 guidelines set out by each facility, if we are to prevent further spread of the virus across our Homes. Our own actions can go a long way in protecting the people we deeply care about,”said Fernandez. She appealed to all families visiting their loved ones to frequently wash  hands, and to wear masks correctly each time they leave home. “Let’s do everything we can to ensure that we stop the further spread of the virus and protect those who are older and live with high-risk comorbidities. I would like to thank everyone who has played a part in ensuring that our province’s old age homes receive support and assistance during this pandemic. “While only a whole-of-society approach will help us keep the infection rate low, and allow us to stay safe and move forward, I remain confident that we can prevent a second wave of the virus from taking place if we work together,” said Fernandez.
